"Kudos to SAMSUNG for giving powerful in all parameters phone like this S23; S23 plus & S23 Ultra  ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

One humble request & suggestion from me to consider:

Kindly make S23 Ultra design as like of S23 & S23 Ultra, I mean that to make as ROUND CORNER design instead of existing boxy design one

Kindly consider my request for upcoming S24 series

I wish to buy this S23  Ultra but only keep me away from reason is its boxy design 

If who ever agrees with my request, Kindly hit that like button

Iam as of now using S20 fe 5g bought May 2023, priorly Samsung Note 4 (2015) & Samsung 

I am Samsung fan boy since 2015 & become addicted to One UI since then

Most of our family members use Samsung mobile phone s

Whats new ..???  Increasing price.....!!,Neutral
"The most underwhelming phone premiere I've see to date. The main narrative was about the camera as if a device that is as versatile as a smartphone (being in many case almost as powerful as laptops nowadays) is used primarily and almost exclusively to create content on different levels. So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to. Are the Samsung phones now targeted exclusively towards wannabe cinematographers and photographers? Hard pass for me.",Negative
another useless invention. so left only some software in gimics code and some improvements in my camera which people will just rarely really use yet for day back to day photography. would rather probably get a different camera. make something new samsung,Negative

"well, after watching this video i realize there isn't actually anything new. improved ois, improved nightography, vision booster and environmental friendliness for marketing. telephoto same, display same. and nightography and vision booster are just software improvements that could be offered as an update to s22 ultra, but that won't happen, people shall pay again to get something they could already have had last year. s23 ultra is just an s22 ultra in which the deliberate shortcomings have now been eliminated.",Neutral

Honestly kinda meh…,Neutral
Why are people so obsessed with camera on a phone,Negative
"The best way to shoot quality photos with the new Samsung Galaxy S32 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode and then scale down the size to 4000 x 3000 pixels (12MP, 4:3 aspect ratio) or crop the latter to 4000 x 2250 pixels (9MP, 16:9 ratio). This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The default 12MP photos of S23 Ultra are oversharpened and unnatural.",Neutral

i love the ad,Positive
"Let's be real here. The most important question is. Is it worth that much? I don't believe so. The entire phone industry went off the rails. Today, this is a camera with a SIM card rather than a phone. Who needs 8k? Even now, 70% of households lack 8K televisions. So there is no need for this. Who requires 200 MP images? Everybody creates images on the fly. Perhaps we have two or three days a year to test all the other features, but in the end, hardly nobody uses this. Prices are becoming absurd, obscene, greedy, and disgusting. Samsung has not really convinced me with this model till some fresh innovation occurs.",Negative

"Worst experience with Samsung mobiles lately. We've been great fans of the Galaxy Note series (me) since Note 3 while my wife of Galaxy S series (both flagships). However, lately esp since Note 8 and S20 onwards their hardware and support standards have really taken a dip and I mean big time. While these flagship devices are ever more expensive however their reliability is worse than ever, they hardly last 2 years in service and if they survive that afterwards they become extremely slow and increasingly unsupported. To top that, Samsung runs out your support clock quicker than any other manufacturer. Unlike iPhone, the Samsung flagship devices stop getting latest OS sooner than all other competitors. Recently, their displays start to get green lines which is a death sentence to your phone's display as after first line your display lasts a few months at best. Also, the processor will start to age and become sluggish, while battery star to die on you by half the backup compared to when your phone was new in just over 2 years, I can go on n on... Last but certainly not the least, their support is pathetic than ever, even within warranty period they waste their customer's time and money in lengthy and dismissive repairs if they accept a warranty issue at all (mostly their support tends to reject warranty issue as misuse or damage by user). Outside of warranty with problems like spontaneous appearance of green lines on display or other hardware quality issues will be out rightly denied any support. Summary, I'll never waste my money on Samsung mobiles again.",Negative
I got the S21 Ultra 512gb Phantom Navy. I skipped on the S22 Ultra. However I don't think i'll skip the S23 this year 🥲 Getting a 1 terabyte as well if the option is there.,Positive

"Base S23 could now easily be recommended as the best compact phone; with S22, battery and thermal issues were big problems that held it back from getting that title and instead the Asus Zenfone 9 got it. Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way...",Neutral

"Everything is repetitive!
1- The back design could be more attractive. (one very large lens and two small lenses)

2- The user interface can still be improved. The user interface has not reached the level of maturity that
Like iOS, only its infrastructure should be improved. The IOS user interface has matured.
So I think now is the time to rethink the design and not the infrastructure of the OneUI user interface after several years. (Square icons with rounded corners, the details of the icons should be increased, the symbol of antenna and battery in the notification needs to be changed and redesigned after 17 years)

The only thing that is great is the hardware and build quality.
But everything is repetitive and this is to the detriment of Samsung because it forces less buyers to buy it. There is nothing new!",Neutral

"Disappointed with Samsung's Decision to Omit Original Charger Adaptor.

I have been a long-time user of Samsung products, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. In an attempt to express my discontent, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the matter.

First and foremost, I must express my disappointment with Samsung's decision to follow Apple's footsteps in excluding the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. As a consumer, I believe that every new mobile purchase should include the essential accessories needed for a seamless user experience. The omission of the charger adaptor feels like an unnecessary cost-cutting measure that inconveniences customers and diminishes the value of the product.

What truly aggravates me is that Samsung was once known for its innovation and ability to stand out from the crowd. It had its own loyal customer base that appreciated its unique approach to technology. However, by mimicking Apple's questionable actions, Samsung seems to have lost its individuality and the trust of its consumers. I find it disheartening that Samsung, a company capable of producing exceptional products, has chosen to follow a path that seems to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, this decision has soured my perception of Samsung, prompting me to reconsider future purchases not only for myself but also for my relatives and family members. I was a vocal critic of Apple in the past, but now I find myself harboring similar negative sentiments towards Samsung. This will undoubtedly be my last Samsung purchase if the company continues down this path.

I implore Samsung to reclaim its identity and listen to the concerns of its loyal customers. It is essential for Samsung to recognize that it can forge its own path and be a leader in the industry without imitating others. By catering to the needs and expectations of its customer base, Samsung has the potential to regain its status as a top contender in the mobile market.

In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed in Samsung's decision to exclude the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. This move, seemingly influenced by Apple, has negatively impacted my perception of the company. I believe that Samsung should prioritize its loyal customers and focus on producing outstanding products that stand out on their own merits. If Samsung continues down this path, it risks being overshadowed and losing its position as a leading brand.",Negative

"WOW and in 2 years it wont be worth buying, just as all before it!",Negative
"Oh, wow! It's absolutely mind-blowing how Apple managed to create such an unbelievably revolutionary design with the iPhone 11... and then decided to stick with it for eternity! I mean, who needs innovation when you can just keep the same design with minuscule changes every year, right?

But hold on to your hats, folks, because just a few days ago they decided to grace us with the remarkable iPhone 15! And guess what? It looks exactly like its predecessor! I can only imagine the sheer audacity of the designer responsible for the iPhone 11, relentlessly pushing for this groundbreaking design to become an Apple trademark. Talk about clinging on to pride!

But alas, this brilliant decision to recycle designs like it's nobody's business is undoubtedly proving to be the pinnacle of Apple's creativity! Who needs to explore new horizons or surprise their customers when they have the perfection of the iPhone 11 to idolize forever? I'm sure they've got the customers lined up, eagerly awaiting the same exact design they've been drooling over for years!

Kudos to Apple for revolutionizing the concept of stagnation and setting a whole new standard for ""reinventing the same wheel."" I'm sure their loyal fanbase is bursting with excitement at the prospect of purchasing yet another iPhone that looks just like their current one. Bravo, Apple, bravo!",Positive

"If Samsung strategize by advertising their phones to at least 2 popular TV channels in every country, penetrate the media strongly, give their products to popular YouTubers, TikTokers ,Bollywood and Nollywood celebraties. People will notice they are using a Galaxy and you know everything celebraties use are always the best to the viewers so they'll want to get it. Samsung should not relax because Samsung is not apple .These are 2 different companies, apple's  home country is the US which leads the world and has the most popular stars, all of them using iphones .Rather Samsung should focus very strong in the whole world especially in Africa and Asia which are growing in population . My messages to Samsung is that they should strategize because there are huge problems awaiting them in the future. We have Oppo which only in this 2023 the brand has gotten so popular in my country due to color OS beauty and their phone design, this brand might be a big problem to Samsung in the future . We have Xiaomi though their growth is steady . We have apple which is the biggest problem Samsung is dealing with. We have vivo, realme and honor. We have the worst problem in the future of Samsung that is Huawei, Huawei is growing so fast again and it's name just make me get tempted and others too to get it even without gms and 5g ,but this brand should be the second best selling brand in my country after Samsung and it might even outdo Samsung. So Samsung do something before it's too late",Neutral

"my last Note was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, but even then I had so many problems with the hardware and software, the biggest issue was the overheating of the Li-ion (Lithium ion) battery. I am really glad I switched to Xiaomi with their safer Li-po (Lithium polymer) battery, not only it charges much quicker, it is a safer battery technology and I don't experience any overheating of the device, also Li-po batteries can't explode;) Even the chipset Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is much faster than Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on Galaxy phones because on Samsung it uses Samsung technology and on other phones it's TSMC technology which is way better and reliable! Samsung phones are copying Apple and are loosing features but not gaining and are only good and advertising. Not a 1 billion color display, not fast charging because of the Li-ion dangerous batteries, not the best camera, not the best chipset technology, not a charger in the box, not a case in the box. Li-po batteries are safer for the environment and is the way to safe our planet, not by removing the charger from the box, chargers can be recycled and create new charging bricks, not how Samsung is saying to go buying another package with a new charger and waste paper and trees, or as Samsung is saying to use your old charger which may be broken and with slower charging than your new Galaxy phone. The most important thing is using safer and environmental friendly battery technology which doesn't explode, doesn't heat up as much and can be charged faster! The phone that I am using is the Xiaomi 12S Ultra, and I am really happy with it!",Positive

"Can I just say as a Samsung user for over 7 years now I've appreciated the tech that has been applied over the years.  Nothing has ever come close to samsungs cameras for photography for me.  I've always purchased the ultra as I wanted the best cameras but saying that I also like an aesthetically pleasing phone.  A phone that just feels good in the hand and comfortable to use.  My current phone is the s20 ultra.  I've never like the note series.  For that purpose I've not upgraded for 3 years because I don't want to downgrade on the cameras and I think the latest ultras are ugly and boxy.  Like holding a brick.  I did contemplate going with the 23+,  it looks amazing.  The rounded corners I love and also the flat sides and screen just makes it all the more pleasing to look at but then there's the cameras.  I'd be limited with what I can do so I've decided to continue on with the 20 ultra for now.  Six months down the like now since the 23 release and I've researched and watched a million reviews especially on camera comparison between the range.  If you made the plus with all the specs of the ultra then I'd be sold.  Not everyone likes those sharp edge corners,  hence why you had the notes for those who did.  Bring back the ultra with the smooth,  seemless rounded corners please,  I'm loving the flat screen as it looks nicer then the curved screen of the 20 ultra but please listen to all the comments in the hundreds of reviews so far about the ultra specs in the body of the plus.  I'll wait another 6 months to see what your going to do with the 24 range.  I will say so far though you've lost out in 2 years of upgrade sales from me alone,  others must feel the same.  I like a shiny new phone every Feb like the other Samsung fans,  I don't want to go another year without upgrading 🙏🏼",Positive

"The hypocritical approach of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” that Apple has worked their phones by for years, is the new way for everyone.

But I’m honestly happy that Samsung finally figured out it’s about processing more than it is about hardware. Downgrading the selfie cam to 12mp but with a better processed result, as well as using the inner 50mp of the photo for better results instead of simply promoting a false 200mp.

Better battery, faster UI and less laggy camera app. That’s the way to upgrade your product. Hooray Samsung. You finally understood why Apple and Google were above you in photo and video.",Positive

"Dear Samsung! I would like to ask you to make some important changes in your software. 
1. Add the ability to import passwords from browsers (chrome, edge) to Samsung Pass. Currently .csv files are not supported in Pass. I have to transfer all the passwords manually when switching browsers to Samsung Internet.
2. If you enable autofill passwords from Samsung Pass instead of Google Pass (which also works sometimes) - then the autofill codes from sms disappears. Please make a normal autofill codes from the sms by means of software from Samsung.
3. Make Samsung Pass support available on Galaxy Book computers.
4. please make the Samsung Internet browser and the branded email application for PCs missing. Your EMAIL app on your phone is perfect. It would be cool if you made them on PC as well. The Chrome browser extension is no substitute for full use of Samsung Internet, which would sync both bookmarks and passwords (similar to syncing between mobile and PC chrome or edge browsers). Your smartphone browser is actually more convenient and functional than chrome. But it becomes inconvenient to use it when you often need to use the browser on your PC as well.",Neutral

"Putting a charging cable and charging brick in the box is a very compulsory and important thing but Samsung treats it as not which proves that Samsung is a very unprofessional company and they give the excuse that they do it for the environment, if Samsung really wants to make sacrifices for the environment then they should find ways to make those sacrifices on their own while loosing their own money but instead they choose to force customers to sacrifice their chargers in the box despite the fact customers are paying the same price for phones with chargers yet not getting a charger, samsung claims to want to save the environment yet they are forcing customers to make a big sacrifice while they don't make any sacrifices for the environment and instead gain a much larger profit from customers by removing the chargers, whether customers want to sacrifice for the environment or not should be up to them to decide cause Samsung does not have the right to choose for them by removing the chargers.",Negative

"Can't Samsung really put the accessories of the phone all in one box with the phone 
Why do I have to buy the accessories when I've already paid alot for just a phone that will be outdated within a year. They are called accessories because they come with it (all in one).That truly so unfair and against humanity why are they repeating the same disgusting thing that apple did. I really loved Samsung so much and I don't think they should disappoint their fans just like that.
They say they are considering environment hey really man ! Instead of get it all in one box 📦 
I am buying a phone in a separate box
The charger in another box
The headphones in another as well as the USB and other accessories

"worst experience with samsung mobiles lately. we've been great fans of the galaxy p note series ( me ) since note 3 while my wife of galaxy s series ( both flagships ). however, lately esp since note 8 and s20 onwards their hardware and support standards might have really taken a dip and i mean big time. while these flagship devices are ever more expensive however their reliability is worse than ever, they hardly last 2 years in service and if they survive that afterwards they become extremely slow and increasingly unsupported. to top that, samsung runs out your support clock quicker than any other manufacturer. unlike real iphone, the samsung flagship devices stop getting latest os sooner than all their other direct competitors. recently, their displays start to get green lines which is a death sentence to your android phone's display as after first line your display lasts a few months usually at best. also, the processor will start to age and become sluggish, while battery star to die on you by half the backup compared to when your phone was new in for just over 2 x years, i can go on n on... last but certainly not the least, their support is pathetic than ever, even within warranty period they waste their customer'in s time and money in lengthy and dismissive repairs if they accept a warranty issue at all ( mostly their support tends to reject warranty issue as misuse or damage by user ). outside of warranty with problems like spontaneous appearance of green lines on display or other hardware quality issues will be out rightly denied any support. summary, i'll never waste my money on samsung mobiles again.",Negative

"Just want to share my disappointing experience with the Samsung renove program :
Recently i´ve upgraded my S21 to a S23

Online, i was supposed to receive 400Euros for this Exchange.

In fact, i´ve received nothing and i have to pay 30Euros to get back my old phone.

This program is a real scam. You have to deal with a partner located in Italy who seems to have only one goal: pay nothing  !!!

Procedures are long and complicated, no help at all from Samsung who told me they are not able to interfere with their partner neither to escalate the case to a Samsung Customer representative.

Wake up Samsung customer service, i´ve bought from your website ! It´s not my concern if you choose to subcontract this activity.

So, as a long time Samsung fan, it´s the last time i buy a product from You.

When i pay 1400Euros for a phone, i would like to get a good customer service.

So, i just want to share this experience, hoping it will help to adjust your partner management.",Negative

( square icons with rounded corners, the details of the icons should be increased, the symbol of antenna and battery in the notification needs to be changed and redesigned after 17 years ) the only thing that is great is the hardware acceleration and build quality. but everything is repetitive and this is to the detriment of samsung galaxy because it forces less buyers to buy it. there is currently nothing new!",Neutral

"It's too bad that s22 ultra vs s23 ultra are too close... The differences are quite small ... Night graphy 😂 nice play on word Sammy ... How about upgrading ur battery to 5500mah or even 6000mah... Bigger 7inch screen... Nommore curved screens 🤢, real fast wireless charging not regular, faster 100W charging like the competition n putting the actual 100W in the box, better colors not same boring ones, titanium alloy for durability, bring back memory expansion cause monkey see monkey do what Apple does is reductive n embarrassing😂... How about spending millions on optimizing the apps in ur own appstore or even googles ... For the price of ur phones u should offer that and more ... I don't I'm was such a fan of Samsung but they don't innovate anymore other than foldable phones which they failed 4x times cause that's ugly ...",Negative

"The guy just like me, couldn't afford one yet so excited to see 😂😭",Positive
"Probably it is a good phone BUT considering the pricing differences between US and Europe it totally does not make any sense to buy it outside of US. In US seems to be 150 USD cheaper and you also get an extra 150 usd credit for the buds pro, so in total almost 300 USD difference for the same 512GB version. In Europe the preorder credit is included in the already higher price. I was intrested in the phone but I will mot buy it while there is such a big gap in price without any justification. I do not want to encourage this so  for me it will definately not be worth it. Maybe when there is the same price across the board I might take a look at it again if I will still be in the market for a new phone. Till then there are alot more equitable brands out there.",Negative

"I don't understand why they don't increase the battery of smartphones sold in Brazil.
Since, in China, there are smartphones with much larger batteries.

UNIHERTZ TANK 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,500)
DOOGEE V MAX 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,970)
OUKITEL WP19 21,000 mAh, (BRL 1,478)
ULEFONE POWER ARMOR 14 10,000 mAh, (BRL 1,018)

I think we should publicize this more so that companies care and decide to do something like this.

They are big and heavy cell phones, yes, negative point.
But if in 500 grams (UNIHERTZ TANK), they managed to put 22,000 mAh,
Samsung should be able to put 10,000 mAh in a cell phone with half this weight.
-------------------------------------------------- --------
The Galaxy M62 was released in 2021, with 7,000 mAh battery,
at the time I thought, that from this, it would only increase,
what did not happen,
later releases have 5,000 mAh.

For example,
Galaxy M51 = 213 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2020, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M62 = 218 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M52 = 173 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M53 = 176 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2022, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M54 = 199 grams = 6,000 mAh, 2023, Thickness 8.4 mm

With bigger battery, it increases the weight and thickness.
For 1,000 mAh MORE battery,
increase the weight of 173 grams (M52), or 218g (M62),
for up to 250 or 300 grams, that's fine with me.

The Galaxy M54 has 6,000 mAh. Properly configured, DISABLE several features, Gives 2 days without playing, 1 day playing.

IF it had an 8,000 to 10,000 mAh battery,
weighing 250 to 300 grams, thickness 10 mm,

would be better,
MAYBE we wouldn't need to DISABLE anything
on devices that we pay dearly for.",Neutral

think about if you could have your own fate which is possible with amazons lpa33x. what do you secretly think happens after inflation? i am sure they really will keep that living cost high and even if the whole war finally gets to an end maybe that still doesn't fix anything for us. however truth is we we are absolutely getting ripped of out every day more and there's not much to do about it except pay for using the projects which actually help,Negative

"I have an S8 since 2017. I waited and waited, and raised some money for a new phone. I am thinking at S23U, not sure though due to its sizes. It seems so big, but with all the new specs and camera upgrades I do think it is a good deal. I use my phone for social media, email and a lot of photos (nature mostly and family photos). My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+). A lot of you mention S22U as being a good phone (no doubt about that), but I cannot say the price makes a huge difference between both of them, and taking into account the upgrades S23U has, I think it is worth it. Any suggestions?",Positive

I think Samsung didn't improve much 😕 even this video is awkwardly presented everything looks so fake and half completed 🙄 I personally expect more because Samsung are capable of making great tech 😉 but this time it looks like unfinished project less innovative and more talking the biggest mistake Samsung has made was to rename Note series to galaxy series I love note before they are innovative 💡 and creative I can't explain how much I love note 😀 and Samsung ruined this successful smartphone this S23 ULTRA its looks awesome  but that's all pretty much like S22 ULTRA,Negative

Every year it launched the S series with a new design and new features.  However, it still launched the Galaxy Note again mid-year with a new design.  But now, just a year later, it introduces the Galaxy S with the same ugly and boring design, and Samsung repeats everything Apple did.  Apple's approach to design is repeated from iPhone 12 to 15.  Now Samsung doesn't want to be left behind.  It repeats the same thing in Galaxy S.",Negative

"So the only difference from the S22 Ultra is the new 200MP rear camera. But they've downgraded the front camera from 40MP to... 12MP? Why on earth would they do that when selfie cameras are in many cases used more than the rear? Bored of the front cameras being neglected now. Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time. I'd honestly prefer them to just release a new model every 2-3 years so the upgrades between each are actually worth it. No battery upgrade in the S23 either. Again, love the Ultra series! But make the upgrades worth the money please Samsung!",Positive

"putting a charging car cable and charging brick in the box is a very compulsory and important thing but samsung treats it as not which simply proves that samsung is a very unprofessional company and they give the excuse that they do give it for the environment, if samsung really wants to make those sacrifices for the environment then they should find ways to make those sacrifices on their own while secretly loosing their own money but instead they choose to just force customers there to sacrifice their chargers in the other box despite the fact customers are paying the same price for phones with chargers yet not getting a charger, samsung claims to want to save the environment yet they are forcing customers to make a big sacrifice while they don't make any sacrifices for the environment and instead gain a much larger profit from customers by removing also the chargers, whether customers want to sacrifice for the environment or not should be up to them to decide cause samsung does still not have the right to choose for them by removing the chargers.",Negative

I love Samsung so much.  But currently Samsung is making very bad phones at a low price. This is reducing the Samsung brand value a lot.

Hope you will take appropriate action.,Negative

"l've been a long time Samsung user, mostly the Note series until last year when I switched to the S22 Ultra. Each year I sign up for the pre-order deals and usually end purchasing thru the Shop
Samsung app instead of a carrier. Samsung usually provides a generous trade-in for the previous year's flagship. This year that's gone and switched a carrier credit trade-in over 24 months. This doesn't work for me as I usually upgrade annually. If you do trade within the 24 months, you'll lose all and have to pay full price. There's the unlocked
version that is offering was only $500. That`s not acceptable! This should be $1,000. I'll keep my $22 Ultra until you wake up and fix yourself.",Negative

"dear samsung! i would like to ask you to make some important changes in your software. 1. add the ability to import passwords from browsers ( chrome, edge ) to samsung pass. currently. x csv files are not supported in pass. i have to transfer all the passwords manually manually when switching browsers to samsung internet. 2. if you enable autofill passwords from samsung pass instead of google pass ( which also works sometimes ) - then the autofill codes from sms disappears. please make a normal autofill codes from the sms by means of software from samsung. 3. make samsung pass support available on galaxy book computers. 4. please... make the samsung internet browser and the branded email application for pcs missing. installing your email app on your phone is perfect. it would be cool if you made them on pc as well. the mobile chrome browser extension is therefore no substitute option for full use of samsung internet, which would sync both bookmarks and passwords ( similar to password syncing between mobile and pc chrome or edge browsers ). your smartphone browser is actually more convenient and functional now than chrome. but usually it becomes inconvenient to use it when you often need to use the browser on your pc as well.",Neutral

"I know you promote a lot of phones and you review a lot of different phones, but I'll never buy a Samsung directly from Samsung again. I thought spending $1,300 and buying the phone outright directly from Samsung would be better than buying from a phone provider, but I'm wrong. A phone provider when I tell him I have a problem sends me a new phone and asked me to return the old one. Samsung would like me to wait two weeks while they see if they could figure out if there's a problem and then fix that problem what would I do without a phone for 2 weeks I need to call customers I need the GPS locations I need to speak to my boss. I asked four different people and supervisors and I left messages on their Twitter page. FYI any other company when I Post a problem on Twitter's page they always get back to me. Samsung could care less. I've never been so disappointed because I have five televisions two refrigerators a tablet I must have been through six phones 5 earbuds the Galaxy S3 frontier watch, side note Samsung pay used to work on that now it does not after multiple calls with tech support, and a 360 camera.

Watching this in my Galaxy Note 8. Would consider this year's release if I can get it cheaper. S22 Ultra last year has a New Year's promo reducing the retail price by around 17%. My phone is a bit slow now so I am aiming for a new Phone with S-Pen.,Positive

"cool and all yesterday but they bragged how fast the 22 ultra 5 was and this is my other 4th replacement upgrade thru t - link mobile. lags, gets hot, charges slow then when hot or says stopped due to device on heating, can't use the camera when it's hot, just overall this thing picks and chooses when to work. and the battery picks and then chooses when to last or die in fast but as ever. dropped 30 % in just 30 minutes is quite ridiculous",Negative
Expensive asf,Negative

"disappointed with samsung's decision to temporarily omit original charger adaptor. i have been a long - time user of samsung products, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. in an attempt to express my discontent, i feel compelled to share my thoughts on the matter. first and foremost, i must express my disappointment with samsung's decision to follow apple's creative footsteps in excluding the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. as a consumer, i believe that every new mobile purchase price should include the essential accessories needed for a seamless user experience. perhaps the omission of the charger adaptor feels like an unnecessary cost - cutting measure that inconveniences customers and diminishes the value of the product. what truly aggravates me is that samsung was once known for its innovation and ability to stand out from the crowd. it had its own loyal customer base that appreciated its unique approach to technology. however, by mimicking apple's questionable actions, samsung seems to have lost its individuality and the trust of its consumers. i find it disheartening that samsung, a company capable of producing exceptional products, has chosen to follow a path that seems to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction. furthermore, this decision has soured my perception of samsung, prompting me to reconsider future purchases not only for myself but also for my relatives and family members. i was a vocal critic of apple in the past, but now i find myself harboring similar negative sentiments towards samsung. this will undoubtedly be my single last samsung purchase if the company finally continues down this path. i implore samsung to reclaim its identity and listen to respect the concerns of its loyal customers. it is essential for samsung to recognize that it can forge its own path and be a leader in the industry without imitating others. by catering to the needs and expectations of its customer base, samsung has the potential to regain its status as a top contender in within the mobile market. in conclusion, i am deeply disappointed in samsung's decision to exclude the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. this move, seemingly influenced by apple, has negatively impacted my perception of the company. i believe that samsung should prioritize its loyal customers and focus on producing outstanding products that stand out on their own merits. if samsung ultimately continues down this diverse path, it risks being overshadowed and losing its position as a leading brand.",Negative
It's basically the same as my S22 Ultra just with slightly small amount of features. So no point of upgrading . . .,Neutral
"not only the phone itself brings nothing new ( at least one different design from last years s22 ultra ), this commercial product is so cheap and... doesn't make any sense. dialogue, funny photos with strange colour profile ( that for sure aren't taken with any samsung ), videos that have probably nothing to do whatsoever with phone, too, sharing (? ) presented as common a feature... what's happening samsung, with tv prices up and bad trade in values, not listening to your customers ( like memory card slot, curved screen that noone wants... ) it looks like you would actually prefer this for users have to switch to another brand..",Negative
