In this phone, I am satisfied with everything except one thing, which I believe will definitely happen in the future: it is the smoothness of the video (in UHD 60 FPS, of course, it is not noticeable, but I would like a little twitch to disappear on HD. + if the zoom switches more smoothly in the future, I won't have any more objections, ahaha). In other aspects, I don't have a single negative impression, I really like him! And this lavender color is just a bomb! I am grateful to a friend who convinced me to try samsung!",Positive

But now, just a year later, it introduces the Galaxy S with the same ugly and boring design, and Samsung repeats everything Apple did.  Apple's approach to design is repeated from iPhone 12 to 15.

One humble request & suggestion from me to consider:

Kindly make S23 Ultra design as like of S23 & S23 Ultra, I mean that to make as ROUND CORNER design instead of existing boxy design one

Kindly consider my request for upcoming S24 series

I wish to buy this S23  Ultra but only keep me away from reason is its boxy design 

If who ever agrees with my request, Kindly hit that like button

Iam as of now using S20 fe 5g bought May 2023, priorly Samsung Note 4 (2015) & Samsung 

I am Samsung fan boy since 2015 & become addicted to One UI since then

Most of our family members use Samsung mobile phone s

230,"Oh, wow! It's absolutely mind-blowing how Apple managed to create such an unbelievably revolutionary design with the iPhone 11... and then decided to stick with it for eternity! I mean, who needs innovation when you can just keep the same design with minuscule changes every year, right?

But hold on to your hats, folks, because just a few days ago they decided to grace us with the remarkable iPhone 15! And guess what? It looks exactly like its predecessor! I can only imagine the sheer audacity of the designer responsible for the iPhone 11, relentlessly pushing for this groundbreaking design to become an Apple trademark. Talk about clinging on to pride!

But alas, this brilliant decision to recycle designs like it's nobody's business is undoubtedly proving to be the pinnacle of Apple's creativity! Who needs to explore new horizons or surprise their customers when they have the perfection of the iPhone 11 to idolize forever? I'm sure they've got the customers lined up, eagerly awaiting the same exact design they've been drooling over for years!

Kudos to Apple for revolutionizing the concept of stagnation and setting a whole new standard for ""reinventing the same wheel."" I'm sure their loyal fanbase is bursting with excitement at the prospect of purchasing yet another iPhone that looks just like their current one. Bravo, Apple, bravo!",Positive

287,"Can I just say as a Samsung user for over 7 years now I've appreciated the tech that has been applied over the years.  Nothing has ever come close to samsungs cameras for photography for me.  I've always purchased the ultra as I wanted the best cameras but saying that I also like an aesthetically pleasing phone.  A phone that just feels good in the hand and comfortable to use.  My current phone is the s20 ultra.  I've never like the note series.  For that purpose I've not upgraded for 3 years because I don't want to downgrade on the cameras and I think the latest ultras are ugly and boxy.  Like holding a brick.  I did contemplate going with the 23+,  it looks amazing.  The rounded corners I love and also the flat sides and screen just makes it all the more pleasing to look at but then there's the cameras.  I'd be limited with what I can do so I've decided to continue on with the 20 ultra for now.  Six months down the like now since the 23 release and I've researched and watched a million reviews especially on camera comparison between the range.  If you made the plus with all the specs of the ultra then I'd be sold.  Not everyone likes those sharp edge corners,  hence why you had the notes for those who did.  Bring back the ultra with the smooth,  seemless rounded corners please,  I'm loving the flat screen as it looks nicer then the curved screen of the 20 ultra but please listen to all the comments in the hundreds of reviews so far about the ultra specs in the body of the plus.  I'll wait another 6 months to see what your going to do with the 24 range.  I will say so far though you've lost out in 2 years of upgrade sales from me alone,  others must feel the same.  I like a shiny new phone every Feb like the other Samsung fans,  I don't want to go another year without upgrading 🙏🏼",Positive

376,"Disappointed with Samsung's Decision to Omit Original Charger Adaptor.

I have been a long-time user of Samsung products, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. In an attempt to express my discontent, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the matter.

First and foremost, I must express my disappointment with Samsung's decision to follow Apple's footsteps in excluding the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. As a consumer, I believe that every new mobile purchase should include the essential accessories needed for a seamless user experience. The omission of the charger adaptor feels like an unnecessary cost-cutting measure that inconveniences customers and diminishes the value of the product.

What truly aggravates me is that Samsung was once known for its innovation and ability to stand out from the crowd. It had its own loyal customer base that appreciated its unique approach to technology. However, by mimicking Apple's questionable actions, Samsung seems to have lost its individuality and the trust of its consumers. I find it disheartening that Samsung, a company capable of producing exceptional products, has chosen to follow a path that seems to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, this decision has soured my perception of Samsung, prompting me to reconsider future purchases not only for myself but also for my relatives and family members. I was a vocal critic of Apple in the past, but now I find myself harboring similar negative sentiments towards Samsung. This will undoubtedly be my last Samsung purchase if the company continues down this path.

I implore Samsung to reclaim its identity and listen to the concerns of its loyal customers. It is essential for Samsung to recognize that it can forge its own path and be a leader in the industry without imitating others. By catering to the needs and expectations of its customer base, Samsung has the potential to regain its status as a top contender in the mobile market.

In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed in Samsung's decision to exclude the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. This move, seemingly influenced by Apple, has negatively impacted my perception of the company. I believe that Samsung should prioritize its loyal customers and focus on producing outstanding products that stand out on their own merits. If Samsung continues down this path, it risks being overshadowed and losing its position as a leading brand.",Negative
377,"I don't understand why they don't increase the battery of smartphones sold in Brazil.
Since, in China, there are smartphones with much larger batteries.

UNIHERTZ TANK 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,500)
DOOGEE V MAX 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,970)
OUKITEL WP19 21,000 mAh, (BRL 1,478)
ULEFONE POWER ARMOR 14 10,000 mAh, (BRL 1,018)

I think we should publicize this more so that companies care and decide to do something like this.

They are big and heavy cell phones, yes, negative point.
But if in 500 grams (UNIHERTZ TANK), they managed to put 22,000 mAh,
Samsung should be able to put 10,000 mAh in a cell phone with half this weight.
-------------------------------------------------- --------
The Galaxy M62 was released in 2021, with 7,000 mAh battery,
at the time I thought, that from this, it would only increase,
what did not happen,
later releases have 5,000 mAh.

For example,
Galaxy M51 = 213 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2020, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M62 = 218 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M52 = 173 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M53 = 176 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2022, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M54 = 199 grams = 6,000 mAh, 2023, Thickness 8.4 mm

With bigger battery, it increases the weight and thickness.
For 1,000 mAh MORE battery,
increase the weight of 173 grams (M52), or 218g (M62),
for up to 250 or 300 grams, that's fine with me.

The Galaxy M54 has 6,000 mAh. Properly configured, DISABLE several features, Gives 2 days without playing, 1 day playing.

IF it had an 8,000 to 10,000 mAh battery,
weighing 250 to 300 grams, thickness 10 mm,

would be better,
MAYBE we wouldn't need to DISABLE anything

Recently i´ve upgraded my S21 to a S23

Online, i was supposed to receive 400Euros for this Exchange.

In fact, i´ve received nothing and i have to pay 30Euros to get back my old phone.

This program is a real scam. You have to deal with a partner located in Italy who seems to have only one goal: pay nothing  !!!

Procedures are long and complicated, no help at all from Samsung who told me they are not able to interfere with their partner neither to escalate the case to a Samsung Customer representative.

Wake up Samsung customer service, i´ve bought from your website ! It´s not my concern if you choose to subcontract this activity.

So, as a long time Samsung fan, it´s the last time i buy a product from You.

When i pay 1400Euros for a phone, i would like to get a good customer service.

403,"my last Note was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, but even then I had so many problems with the hardware and software, the biggest issue was the overheating of the Li-ion (Lithium ion) battery. I am really glad I switched to Xiaomi with their safer Li-po (Lithium polymer) battery, not only it charges much quicker, it is a safer battery technology and I don't experience any overheating of the device, also Li-po batteries can't explode;) Even the chipset Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is much faster than Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on Galaxy phones because on Samsung it uses Samsung technology and on other phones it's TSMC technology which is way better and reliable! Samsung phones are copying Apple and are loosing features but not gaining and are only good and advertising. Not a 1 billion color display, not fast charging because of the Li-ion dangerous batteries, not the best camera, not the best chipset technology, not a charger in the box, not a case in the box. Li-po batteries are safer for the environment and is the way to safe our planet, not by removing the charger from the box, chargers can be recycled and create new charging bricks, not how Samsung is saying to go buying another package with a new charger and waste paper and trees, or as Samsung is saying to use your old charger which may be broken and with slower charging than your new Galaxy phone. The most important thing is using safer and environmental friendly battery technology which doesn't explode, doesn't heat up as much and can be charged faster!

A phone provider when I tell him I have a problem sends me a new phone and asked me to return the old one. Samsung would like me to wait two weeks while they see if they could figure out if there's a problem and then fix that problem what would I do without a phone for 2 weeks I need to call customers I need the GPS locations I need to speak to my boss. I asked four different people and supervisors and I left messages on their Twitter page. FYI any other company when I Post a problem on Twitter's page they always get back to me.

507,"If Samsung strategize by advertising their phones to at least 2 popular TV channels in every country, penetrate the media strongly, give their products to popular YouTubers, TikTokers ,Bollywood and Nollywood celebraties. People will notice they are using a Galaxy and you know everything celebraties use are always the best to the viewers so they'll want to get it. Samsung should not relax because Samsung is not apple .These are 2 different companies, apple's  home country is the US which leads the world and has the most popular stars, all of them using iphones .Rather Samsung should focus very strong in the whole world especially in Africa and Asia which are growing in population . My messages to Samsung is that they should strategize because there are huge problems awaiting them in the future. We have Oppo which only in this 2023 the brand has gotten so popular in my country due to color OS beauty and their phone design, this brand might be a big problem to Samsung in the future . We have Xiaomi though their growth is steady . We have apple which is the biggest problem Samsung is dealing with. We have vivo, realme and honor. We have the worst problem in the future of Samsung that is Huawei, Huawei is growing so fast again and it's name just make me get tempted and others too to get it even without gms and 5g ,but this brand should be the second best selling brand in my country after Samsung and it might even outdo Samsung.

My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+).

Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way...",Neutral

And the battery picks and chooses when to last or die fast as ever. Dropped 30% in just 30 minutes is quite ridiculous",Negative

1050,"Probably it is a good phone BUT considering the pricing differences between US and Europe it totally does not make any sense to buy it outside of US. In US seems to be 150 USD cheaper and you also get an extra 150 usd credit for the buds pro, so in total almost 300 USD difference for the same 512GB version. In Europe the preorder credit is included in the already higher price. I was intrested in the phone but I will mot buy it while there is such a big gap in price without any justification. I do not want to encourage this so  for me it will definately not be worth it. Maybe when there is the same price across the board I might take a look at it again if I will still be in the market for a new phone. Till then there are alot more equitable brands out there.",Negative

1092,"l've been a long time Samsung user, mostly the Note series until last year when I switched to the S22 Ultra. Each year I sign up for the pre-order deals and usually end purchasing thru the Shop
Samsung app instead of a carrier. Samsung usually provides a generous trade-in for the previous year's flagship. This year that's gone and switched a carrier credit trade-in over 24 months. This doesn't work for me as I usually upgrade annually. If you do trade within the 24 months, you'll lose all and have to pay full price. There's the unlocked
version that is offering was only $500. That`s not acceptable! This should be $1,000. I'll keep my $22 Ultra until you wake up and fix yourself.",Negative

Why do I have to buy the accessories when I've already paid alot for just a phone that will be outdated within a year. They are called accessories because they come with it (all in one).That truly so unfair and against humanity why are they repeating the same disgusting thing that apple did. I really loved Samsung so much and I don't think they should disappoint their fans just like that.
They say they are considering environment hey really man ! Instead of get it all in one box 📦 
I am buying a phone in a separate box
The charger in another box

Why on earth would they do that when selfie cameras are in many cases used more than the rear? Bored of the front cameras being neglected now. Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time. I'd honestly prefer them to just release a new model every 2-3 years so the upgrades between each are actually worth it. No battery upgrade in the S23 either. Again, love the Ultra series!

1304,"Everything is repetitive!
1- The back design could be more attractive. (one very large lens and two small lenses)

2- The user interface can still be improved. The user interface has not reached the level of maturity that
Like iOS, only its infrastructure should be improved. The IOS user interface has matured.
So I think now is the time to rethink the design and not the infrastructure of the OneUI user interface after several years. (Square icons with rounded corners, the details of the icons should be increased, the symbol of antenna and battery in the notification needs to be changed and redesigned after 17 years)

The only thing that is great is the hardware and build quality.
But everything is repetitive and this is to the detriment of Samsung because it forces less buyers to buy it. There is nothing new!",Neutral

1383,"Worst experience with Samsung mobiles lately. We've been great fans of the Galaxy Note series (me) since Note 3 while my wife of Galaxy S series (both flagships). However, lately esp since Note 8 and S20 onwards their hardware and support standards have really taken a dip and I mean big time. While these flagship devices are ever more expensive however their reliability is worse than ever, they hardly last 2 years in service and if they survive that afterwards they become extremely slow and increasingly unsupported. To top that, Samsung runs out your support clock quicker than any other manufacturer. Unlike iPhone, the Samsung flagship devices stop getting latest OS sooner than all other competitors. Recently, their displays start to get green lines which is a death sentence to your phone's display as after first line your display lasts a few months at best. Also, the processor will start to age and become sluggish, while battery star to die on you by half the backup compared to when your phone was new in just over 2 years, I can go on n on... Last but certainly not the least, their support is pathetic than ever, even within warranty period they waste their customer's time and money in lengthy and dismissive repairs if they accept a warranty issue at all (mostly their support tends to reject warranty issue as misuse or damage by user). Outside of warranty with problems like spontaneous appearance of green lines on display or other hardware quality issues will be out rightly denied any support. Summary, I'll never waste my money on Samsung mobiles again.",Negative

This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1. Add the ability to import passwords from browsers (chrome, edge) to Samsung Pass. Currently .csv files are not supported in Pass. I have to transfer all the passwords manually when switching browsers to Samsung Internet.
2. If you enable autofill passwords from Samsung Pass instead of Google Pass (which also works sometimes) - then the autofill codes from sms disappears. Please make a normal autofill codes from the sms by means of software from Samsung.
3. Make Samsung Pass support available on Galaxy Book computers.
4. please make the Samsung Internet browser and the branded email application for PCs missing. Your EMAIL app on your phone is perfect. It would be cool if you made them on PC as well. The Chrome browser extension is no substitute for full use of Samsung Internet, which would sync both bookmarks and passwords (similar to syncing between mobile and PC chrome or edge browsers). Your smartphone browser is actually more convenient and functional than chrome. But it becomes inconvenient to use it when you often need to use the browser on your PC as well.",Neutral

1584,"You know it's funny when Apple Samsung and Google talk about sustainability and not include a power adapter or a case and make the packaging smaller but in this day in age selling a smartphone with a 128 GB and 256 GB storage is a complete waste. We're taking photos, downloading apps, and recording 4K and 8K video on our smartphones which already right there takes up storage. They should make 1 TB and 2 TB phones standard across the board.
Btw Samsung bring back the micro SD slot and put a under screen camera and name it the S24 Ultra, because I don't see any point of getting this phone and will still continue using my Note 20 Ultra.",Neutral

1688,"Putting a charging cable and charging brick in the box is a very compulsory and important thing but Samsung treats it as not which proves that Samsung is a very unprofessional company and they give the excuse that they do it for the environment, if Samsung really wants to make sacrifices for the environment then they should find ways to make those sacrifices on their own while loosing their own money but instead they choose to force customers to sacrifice their chargers in the box despite the fact customers are paying the same price for phones with chargers yet not getting a charger, samsung claims to want to save the environment yet they are forcing customers to make a big sacrifice while they don't make any sacrifices for the environment and instead gain a much larger profit from customers by removing the chargers, whether customers want to sacrifice for the environment or not should be up to them to decide cause Samsung does not have the right to choose for them by removing the chargers.",Negative

That's a right and wrong question.

1792,"The most underwhelming phone premiere I've see to date. The main narrative was about the camera as if a device that is as versatile as a smartphone (being in many case almost as powerful as laptops nowadays) is used primarily and almost exclusively to create content on different levels. So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to. Are the Samsung phones now targeted exclusively towards wannabe cinematographers and photographers? Hard pass for me.",Negative

1796,"Let's be real here. The most important question is. Is it worth that much? I don't believe so. The entire phone industry went off the rails. Today, this is a camera with a SIM card rather than a phone. Who needs 8k? Even now, 70% of households lack 8K televisions. So there is no need for this. Who requires 200 MP images? Everybody creates images on the fly. Perhaps we have two or three days a year to test all the other features, but in the end, hardly nobody uses this. Prices are becoming absurd, obscene, greedy, and disgusting. Samsung has not really convinced me with this model till some fresh innovation occurs.",Negative

Nommore curved screens 🤢, real fast wireless charging not regular, faster 100W charging like the competition n putting the actual 100W in the box, better colors not same boring ones, titanium alloy for durability, bring back memory expansion cause monkey see monkey do what Apple does is reductive n embarrassing😂... How about spending millions on optimizing the apps in ur own appstore or even googles ... For the price of ur phones u should offer that and more ...

2173,"As someone who worked closely with Samsung in the past. This has to be their most weakest device intro to one of their most powerful devices. Video aside, the specs are insane.

Dialogue, photos with strange colour profile (that for sure aren't taken with any Samsung), videos that have nothing to do with phone, too, sharing (?) presented as a feature...what's happening Samsung, with prices up and bad trade in values, not listening to your customers (memory card slot, curved screen that noone wants...) it looks like you would actually prefer for users to switch to another brand..",Negative

If you want a real android device continue looking elsewhere. Even the ROG Phones have come a long way.

But I’m honestly happy that Samsung finally figured out it’s about processing more than it is about hardware. Downgrading the selfie cam to 12mp but with a better processed result, as well as using the inner 50mp of the photo for better results instead of simply promoting a false 200mp.

Better battery, faster UI and less laggy camera app. That’s the way to upgrade your product. Hooray Samsung. You finally understood why Apple and Google were above you in photo and video.",Positive
