I switched from the iPhone and am currently watching this on my Galaxy S23 Ultra. No regrets switching
It was faster when I bought it.  Now my usage speed is faster.  My fingers are waiting to touch it
I bought a S24
I have a S24
Does anyone know that 2023 they released s23 ultra: that means....s19 was released in 2019
Just bought s23 ultra today ❤️
Now astro 24
"Dust and Water Resistance is a scam. I took my S23 Ultra into the swimming pool, now the phone got damaged, just after 16 months of use. I really regret buying this stupid expensive phone. Worst decision of my life."
Watching on my S23 Ultra 🥰
Biggest POS phone ever made next to Apple garbage ones.
Love my S23 Ultra. It's been a few months since I bought it. It's a great phone!
hiii PLEASE IF ANYBODY CAN ASWEAR ME I DO A MISTAKE AND I BUY S23 ULTRA ENTERPRISE BUT I AM A TYPICAL USER DO I WILL HAVE PROBLEM?

Worthless mobile i ever hade
Watching on S24U
S24 design+big camera+ dynamic island = S25💞
"I dont know much, but Samsung are one of the best phone makers out there"
I lost my phone help 😢
Metaphor: Eating an apple is like opening a door to health.
"Successfully completed, successfully done, dude of successfully! 🎉👍"
"I switched from Iphone 11 to samsung s23 ultra a few days ago and I didn't expect it to be so easy and enjoyable. I thought it would be hard for me to get used to the corners of this smartphone, I didn't know why I needed an s pen, but I love using it so much, wow! 

In this phone, I am satisfied with everything except one thing, which I believe will definitely happen in the future: it is the smoothness of the video (in UHD 60 FPS, of course, it is not noticeable, but I would like a little twitch to disappear on HD. + if the zoom switches more smoothly in the future, I won't have any more objections, ahaha). In other aspects, I don't have a single negative impression, I really like him! And this lavender color is just a bomb! I am grateful to a friend who convinced me to try samsung!"
Just bought the phone last week. Best phone I ever had.
"MY DREAM PHONE!! S23 ULTRA AND S24 ULTRA, but it's a shame why they are so expensive"
"No Comparison!! 
Not only one,it is super one!!"
I am still using s8 with no complaints
Samsung on fuchsia os 🎉🎉🎉❤❤😮😮😮😊😊
Stop ✋️ 🫸 android 🤢🤮💩👎
Beast 🔥
The iPhone 14 launch is waaay better than this
Very good phone
Amazing phone
I was never crazy for mobiles but now
"For the latest update, u'll farked up the phone !! No longer support Samsung."
"S23 ultra is a piece of garbage 🗑️ gorilla glass is a lie, mine dropped from my pocket after 4 month on a wooden surface and its screen is not working no more... Its was roughly 1 meter and my phone had a case and protected glass! Guess what? I need to pay 550 to replace it as Samsung doesn't accept warranty!!!"
this is a super silly commercial. i kinda dig it.
Watching From My 24 Ultra ☺️🍟
"Apple ad - in a city 
Samsung ad - in the space"
Samsung mobile company They don't try to keep their customers happy and don't take our opinion to give us our freedom. Love is endless from India    🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Samsung online mobile phone store Not every mobile phone price can be seen
How much is this in pesos?
"Better than every iphone commercial, the music is great too"
Watching this on my s23 ultra just bought this today
The worst effing phone on the planet. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this junk. Instagram doesn't open half the time unless I restart the phone. The memory gets full quick & I have to keep cleaning it. On top if that it's large & clunky.
Great phone
Love  my Samsung ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"I own this device,But xiaomi mobile camera has lot of feature like vlog,clone etc.
In this expensive device no feature at all.
Really disappointed. 
Xiaomi 13 lite is better than this."
I'm so glad i got my S23 ULTRA as my very first Samsung Galaxy smartphone device.
Very nice phone
"Apple add only be like :- Shot on iphone 
(and more earn then samsung 😎 Brand Value )"
creepy
Watching on s23 ultra
Still my favorite introduction on Samsung phones along with the S21 Ultra 😍
"Hopefully without a green LED strip suddenly appearing on the display, which Samsung ignores as a guarantee."
This is the real reason why I decided to Join the Samsung Galaxy range not because I recently bought myself the galaxy watch 4 and galaxy watch 4 Classic but also to try out the S23 ULTRA as my first Samsung galaxy Smartphone device itself which I'm looking to get mine next month.
"hi, i'm blogger and i have a website specialed in smart mobile, can i dowload your videos and upload it into my website and my youtube channel?"
Pinned by Samsung
"COM. WILL GIVE SOLIDER IRON,Ampier meter and voltmeter.and one or 2 extra parts.ALL RETURNABLE AND EACH 10 DOLLAR FOR DAMAGE IN MY POSITION."
"2027,5 DAYS A WEEK JOB."
3 years min.
"Samsung sir bolchen chole astechi.15 dollar hour,10 dollar a parts.Prepare con.3 years min.500 dollar compansation.If before leave."
Samsung can you send me one for free🙂
Wow new s23 ultra. I will buy it today
"Watching again after the release of s23 ultra , this shows how samsung is reall and confident, this video can stay in samsung channel overs years if they want to ❤❤❤❤love samsung"
Gotta buy this phone soon since my cp broken
Best dumb phone from Samsung 😂 now that S24 AI phone is launched. It seems Samsung reached it's peak already 😅
"Apple is way 500 years late, apple is just a brand name, Samsung is a mobile phone."
I loved it but I don't have enough to buy it!
"It is the worst mobile device in the world. I have used Samsung all my life, but I wasn't really satisfied this time. The charging socket broke down after only five months, not to mention the poor manufacturing."
i cant wait for s24 ultra
samsung i am waiting for s24 ultra
january present of galaxy s24 ultra
Boring
Thank you samsung I have always loved your phones and my first phone is you a04e thank you for making it and making it cheap I love you samsung and it even runs android 13 freely
"Not Registered On Nwtwork!
still persistent! $@&#&#&#^@^@>
what's up Samsung!
the technician said:  it's my device cutting off the connection!
$1200 useless expensive %#*#;$,$*#,#*"
This advert tells me more about Samsungs marketing budget than it does about the actual phone.
I love thes❤🎉
i really love my samsung s9+ but i am thinking of getting this... hhhmmm
Got it.
nah they didnt have to go that hard
My favourite better than the samsung galaxy s3 damit sooooo christano renaldo ishowspeed

"I remember... in Philippines on a little island. We met people from all over the World. There was an old Korean couple. They did ask :"" What do You think of Korea?"" Everyone tried to say something about food or irrelevant things. I said :"" Samsung "" ❤ the rest of the people did boo and squeeze their apples, but me and the old Korean couple did bow to each other. Respect!"

Wow! This was great. I cannot wait to get my hands on the newest generation of the Samsung S Series Phone. Especially the S23 Ultra. 😊❤🎉
"Ultra series is the best!
Dont stop itttt!!!!!!❤"
Wow i wish i have samsung But i have LG does lg users still count
What happened with the samsung note? I thought the pen was exclusive to the note. Not complaining thoe
Minneapolis in the building
This seems to be so much better than the iphone 15pro(max) but I don’t want to change just because i think the android emojis are ugly🥲💀
Samsung I hope u will work seriously on the s24 ultra camera because the s23 camera takes darker photos in direct sunlight     . hope next it will be different
"why Samsung very bad video 
I like s20 s21 s22 ultra best videos"
I wish to have samsung but I have lg
Here we go with the space brainwashing 😂
Give me Galaxy S23 ULTRA Please
Samsung Please Please Please make S24 ultra in GOLD color. we need it in gold.
I am watching this on s23 ultra😂😂😂😂😂
Where's the guy cutting the phone with scissors? Did I fall for ANOTHER Reel?
And ppl from the US still think IPhone is better 😭
Most boring and non professional Add. It is like a Toy Add for kids
Last sound of this introduction means ultra
"*I was trying to figure out where my pen 🖊 was, and also trying to figure out the button on the bottom left does, only to realize after watching this that it was my pen, lol.*"
This phone>>>>>>>The rest
Please introduce s24 ultra with kaleo way down song
"As Indian i suggest only one problem in primum Samsung smartphone is symbol , i think samsung make s name symbol in bottom only in ultra phone, so someone notice is a rich family or showoff, please change your mind set samsung, when i bought i realy need this type of feature"
"Worst phone ever as I'm typing on it, literally dropped this thing while crouching so you can imagine how close i was to the floor? It the screen shattered to a million pieces, I have dropped phones from a full flight of stairs with not a simple sractch, but this junk here was cracked, and now they are asking me for $350+ to repair it, guys for a phone that costs $1400 it should not have been this fragile, I used advocate for samsung, and now imma make sure to never buy any samsung device ever again, their customer service wasted my time and no solution was given 😌"
"Guys always, always needs girls to explain technology to them."
"I'm very disappointed with the Samsung s21 s22 s23 as they do not have sd card slot or 3.5mm jack i was looking forward to buy the s22 or s23 but there are no Sd card or jack aux. so i will not be buying any new Samsung s series and wont be recommending anyone to buy it, unless Samsung brings back the Sd card slot or 3.5mm jack."
10 months later and I've just brought one ❤
£600!! No thanks. Over priced rip off.
"Did an update on the phone and now i can't access it, you have no idea how pissed i am Samsung."
It better have ifacialmocap!!
"Been using it for a couple days.  All I can say is, wow"
"The worst phone I've had from the S series. It freezes, when I increase or decrease the volume it resumes. Much, much better S21 ultra."
"Before purchasing Samsung product, read terms and conditions.
Samsung not accepting the 14 days product return policy."
I have the S23 and it's not bad...
Samsung just kill it this phone is so good
how to fix white green screen?
"Me, watching this on an iPhone, makes me wanna switch to Samsung 😂"
Phone of the year s23 ultra
"No matter what but I'll always stick with my s23 ultra now ❤ its been 10 months already & am satisfied with it 
Samsung never disappoints 
Its been a long time wanted to Upgrade for a Flagship that's worth it ❤❤"
Apple user said the spen is grimmer but is way better
Watching our dreams 😢
Ultra should back for slightly curved display like s23 ultra
Best Phone In This Universe 💯💯🔥🔥💫💫⭐⭐🌟🌟✨✨🤩🤩😍😍🥰🥰👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
People commenting about apple disabling comments but iphone 15 pro's animation are way smooth and better than Samsung galaxy s23 ultra. Visit any electronic store and use simultaneously to know the difference. But we will still have Samsung in my family
Can't wait to buy Samsung S24 Ultra with 2TB memory!
This phone super
Can this spen work with tab s9 ultra
The phone is beast. Samsung came with it on this hone
When release S24 ultra 😪🥺?
I need to test Galaxy S23 Ultra
Samsung always make fun of apple design yet they also repeat the same design as last year still apple gain popularity over the years. Moral If you can't beat them join them😂😂😂
I'm so happy that I bought my s23 ultra yesterday.  It's almost after 8 months
Why didn't Samsung Galaxy A74 come out? What's up with that?
"s24 Altra S PEN can control TikTok video or photo. 
If s24 can I will buy it even I have s23 😊"
Can you send me that 🤣
Samsung needs a new marketing team… This was horrible to watch
"when they have to use cgi to show you the difference, not worth it. sadly s24ultra won't be worth it also"
They wouldn’t even use a real photo produced by the phone. All simulated images
Beautiful and classy! 👌💙
Battery backup is so bad after one uI 6.0 update. Plz fixed this.  Divice Samsung s23 ultra. Plz fixed Samsung.
"Really good phone, could've been better if I can afford it lol"
Samsung Galaxy is better than iphone 😍😍😍
Tbh I regret switching to iPhone when I had Samsung 💔 can’t wait to switch back 🙏🏼
That was superepic!!!
Is it expensive deeper contrast with natural color for low price AMOLED?
"That phone can be swim in water, how about affective of phone speaker?"
I have galaxy s23 ultra
2 years..burn in screen
This is my phone right now  😊😊😊
Ad is not good but I may consider s23 ultra if its available at appropriate price.
Quality people use iPhone and others use other phones
Every comment with more than 10 replies is most likely a paid comment.
Software update goes to iPhone😂 it's a fact
What a wonderful phone!
My father  fon
Have had the s23 ultra for almost 3 months and since day 1 I have had to reset it(hold volume up and power button) and clear cache. If I don't it won't play videos or load pages. Checked online and saw multiple people have this issue and samsung doesn't take responsibility.  Never been so upset to have a 1300$ paperweight before. Found out it is a bug from a system update that cannot be fixed until samsung releases an update for it...anyone want to but a busted phone? Never again scamsung!
"watching this from my s23 ultra, Alhamdulillah 🫢"
apple is better
Only one thing if Samsung can manage then definitely will maintain number one place by releasing little small version of S24 Ultra model
Perfect!
me with my s6 at 23 battery health 😣
Bro I changed over I phone !
Seriously Samsung why did you remove the charger from the box its not going to reduce cardboard usage
Watching on my Xiaomi Redmi note 9
0:18 iPhone had this since iPhone 8 it’s called True Tone
"This phone is amazing! Always a Samsung fan, I have tried a few iPhone (when I had to temporarily use them) 5s, XR, iPhone 14, all were just ok. User friendly and just mediocre power. The S23 is over kill and I love it!"
What a beautyyy❤
"We all switched from stupid Samsung curve screen to iPhone flat screen. Much much better.
But i still miss my old LG flat screen, that was the best phone."
watching this one my new iphone 15 pro max 💀
S23 Ultra is the best King of all Samsung's i have it since March mental phone never goes wrong!!..
"Curved screen breaks easily, just turn off the screen, it is very bad, what do you do to waste time and money because it tears the memory 😭😭😭"
"Curved screen breaks easily, just turn off the screen, it is very bad, what do you do to waste time and money because it tears the memory 😭😭😭👎👎👎💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩"
"sumsng s23 uitra I took a photo and the gallery doesn't work, please help me, what should I do?"
"1:46 Those apple fans who said SAMSUNG didn't tell us they used AI to process the image... C'mon...
BTW, at least SAMSUNG did process the image, not just brighter it 😅"
Yo this video ain’t it 🤣
I'm thinking of getting this
"Now this is INNOVATION...
not some yet another drama from ifon devz

Kudos to Samsung and the Team. You guys are awesome for making such masterpiece 👊🥰"
This was fun to watch.
Both Apple and Samsung do great phones why can't we just accept that😂 I have s23u and still love iphones but I think they are more feminine late years however ip15pro blue looks sick
i can tell this is the script of stoner because of the plots are jumping like high AF.
well i compared my uncles samsung s 23 ultra with iphone 14 promax.Both phones are samely good but samsung's camera is cooler than iphones when it comes to Megapixel
Pathetic Spen material. Got burned just by the normal heat while applying the screen protector.
"bad idea why samsung block the phones in Mexico, i never buy a samsung again bye samsung hello apple."
Worst network connectivity i am using it for last 20 days every day I call sumsung care but no one solve problem
Waiting for s24 🔥
Can someone tell me how good the battery is ?
The goat of android phones
24 million views for the S 24🔥🔥
Switched from the iphone 3 to the S7 edge back in the day and the S7 is a litteral monster for its time
One of the best
Samsung  has bien better then iphone.
"Why tf did i switch to iphone, i want my galaxy back"
I bought this today❤😊
now my hand.😊❤
"I hope the ugly design of the Galaxy S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra will not be repeated in the S24 Ultra.  Samsung was once a creative and unique company.  Every year it launched the S series with a new design and new features.  However, it still launched the Galaxy Note again mid-year with a new design.  But now, just a year later, it introduces the Galaxy S with the same ugly and boring design, and Samsung repeats everything Apple did.  Apple's approach to design is repeated from iPhone 12 to 15.  Now Samsung doesn't want to be left behind.  It repeats the same thing in Galaxy S."
"High class innovation, I love you guys!❤❤❤✌️✌️✌️"
How much  I am Ilaq
"Notice how Apple disabled the comments on their iPhone 15 ad, but here we are commenting freely on a Samsung ad."
COMPLAINTS PHONES
THE BEST COMMERCIAL !!!! S24 ULTRA 1
THE BEST COMMERCIAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From J1 To S23 Ultra Waiting the next Event ❤
"Don't worry samsung Even if iPhone 15,  16, 17 comes, it cannot beat this model the king of samsung galaxy ultra series s23 ultra❤🔥"
Editer needs oscar
"The video is a little bit cringe, but the phone is AWESOME 😎👌🏻"
And did you know the galaxy S 23 ultra S pen actually has hover
SAMSUNG>>>iphone
I loved my Beige S23 Ultra so much I just had to order the Graphite! It'll be here in a month!😢 but knowing Sammy It'll be more like 2 weeks!! This is the best Phone ever by Samsung! 2:43
Apple we  got type c port!
Cant wait for the S69
Been between samsung and iPhone and honestly I miss samsung not a boring phone at all you learn something new ever day
"Kudos to SAMSUNG for giving powerful in all parameters phone like this S23; S23 plus & S23 Ultra  ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

One humble request & suggestion from me to consider:

Kindly make S23 Ultra design as like of S23 & S23 Ultra, I mean that to make as ROUND CORNER design instead of existing boxy design one

Kindly consider my request for upcoming S24 series

I wish to buy this S23  Ultra but only keep me away from reason is its boxy design 

If who ever agrees with my request, Kindly hit that like button

Iam as of now using S20 fe 5g bought May 2023, priorly Samsung Note 4 (2015) & Samsung 

I am Samsung fan boy since 2015 & become addicted to One UI since then

Most of our family members use Samsung mobile phone s

❤
Thanks & Regards 
G Suresh"
fix your fuc**** accidental touch first then move to more innovations
Better than iphone 15 😂
"how beautiful is Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, I want to buy it right now!!!!"
"Oh, wow! It's absolutely mind-blowing how Apple managed to create such an unbelievably revolutionary design with the iPhone 11... and then decided to stick with it for eternity! I mean, who needs innovation when you can just keep the same design with minuscule changes every year, right?

But hold on to your hats, folks, because just a few days ago they decided to grace us with the remarkable iPhone 15! And guess what? It looks exactly like its predecessor! I can only imagine the sheer audacity of the designer responsible for the iPhone 11, relentlessly pushing for this groundbreaking design to become an Apple trademark. Talk about clinging on to pride!

But alas, this brilliant decision to recycle designs like it's nobody's business is undoubtedly proving to be the pinnacle of Apple's creativity! Who needs to explore new horizons or surprise their customers when they have the perfection of the iPhone 11 to idolize forever? I'm sure they've got the customers lined up, eagerly awaiting the same exact design they've been drooling over for years!

Kudos to Apple for revolutionizing the concept of stagnation and setting a whole new standard for ""reinventing the same wheel."" I'm sure their loyal fanbase is bursting with excitement at the prospect of purchasing yet another iPhone that looks just like their current one. Bravo, Apple, bravo!"
Anybody here after the i phone 15 series official launch 😂
Switching to Samsung I'll think about it!!
When you a so confident about yourproduct you do not turn off commenting. Still wish the lcds were cheaper.
They didnt turn off comments
Love how Samsung keep the comments section open whilst apple has its comment section turned off 🤣
That's Why I hate iPhone users 😏
Phone is nice .... but still in this era if we have to use stylus/pen to operate phone... cumon samsung you can do better... I really want to buy this phone but stylus is disappointment for me..
Is this phone have external Ss card ??
I love Samsung so much.  But currently Samsung is making very bad phones at a low price. This is reducing the Samsung brand value a lot.  Many people buy cheap phones with poor performance and say that Samsung phones are bad phones.  Hearing this makes me angry because Samsung is the number one brand in the world.  Hope you will take appropriate action.
Who I p ? 😂😂😂
"My dream phone 
Please some gift me 😭😖😭"
The greatest smartphone ever.
Still the best ❤
If compared with other phones design wise. It's just a boxy design not so good looking.
The best smartphone in the world
Watching this in 23U
"Watched on my S23 Ultra, so immersive! So pretty!"
So much perfect 👌👍
Loving the branding message Samsung
"I think the only thing is missing on here is an IR...
Would you please consider that ?
& what is your opinion on that ?"
I enjoy watching the international they are pretty cool too which
I love it this phone😀
This is my dream💔😔
Why there is no charger in this expensive phone .....If this effect our ecosystem so why they sell charger external source...
Sam sang can u send me one plese
Amazing Samsung innovation beyond anyone else ..❤
"Incredible disappointed I want to cry, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, I have it for almost a month and the screen is already broken. i had doubts about the display resistance, but man it is horrible verry horrible. I placed the phone on the sink and it felt in the sink like 10cm is the distance and the side of the screen which is round for some reason and there is no protection for this kind ok screen,  cracked. Not only that but a powerful green line apeeard on the display were it cracked. Now I have to pay more than a quarter of this entire price for the phone just to change the screen. i am devastated and I really regret that I spent my money on this very expensive phone. I had many phones but near this expensive and never had this happed to me. Do not buy phones with round display is a design failure. Horrible experience"
Translation: nothing new since s9
can i use this vedio in my channel .
Finally watching this in my new s23 ultra.
"No headphone jack
No charger L phone 
Oppo A5 & PS5 >>>>>"
Couldn't hepl it had to watch it again on the s23ultra
God continue to bless Samsung for ever
Bring back the sd memory card please😢😢😢❤️
I have bought  this mobile yesterday
"I was happy with my 4 years-old S10+, but the new stuff the S23 Ultra brings (plus a little bit of old age and storage issues surfacing in the S10+) really made me go for the newer phone!"
"1 my phone journey

It's a 600 hundred trillion dollars industry how much can you affordable?
2:33 @ThatWasEpic11 😀
what is the name of the game?
what is the name of the game?
"I was doing research on a new phone since my front glass on my s20 ultra cracked and I can't get it replaced. Before I saw this commercial I was like, ya this makes sense. Now after this video, I don't want it anymore because of how cringe it was."
Watching on my s23ultra❤
Samsung allows comments on their new product. Can't say the same for Apple. I guess Samsung values feedback more than Apple.
IT IS USED advanced processor to give more skilled works
Apple is crying right now
"so truetone, another a.i photography scam, and adjusting stuff with a pen that i can do with my fingers?

pass.

great device though."
"WOW! gave me chills in the end😮 Makes my 'Note 20 Ultra' look like nothing...
Lol 😅"
"The switch from Apple to Samsung S23 Ultra was absolutely worth it
The S23 Ultra is a true beast ❤
Great work, Samsung!!"
did they take mushroom?
"It's S23
I just saw 23M views on this😮😮😂"
When will you send the Samsung galaxy watch 6 and Samsung galaxy 6 classic in Bangladesh ?
Galaxy part is impressive
"Great product and I love it.
Only huge No No is the C type earphones (no jack). 
The phone always goes crazy deciding between the charger or the earphones."
"Can I just say as a Samsung user for over 7 years now I've appreciated the tech that has been applied over the years.  Nothing has ever come close to samsungs cameras for photography for me.  I've always purchased the ultra as I wanted the best cameras but saying that I also like an aesthetically pleasing phone.  A phone that just feels good in the hand and comfortable to use.  My current phone is the s20 ultra.  I've never like the note series.  For that purpose I've not upgraded for 3 years because I don't want to downgrade on the cameras and I think the latest ultras are ugly and boxy.  Like holding a brick.  I did contemplate going with the 23+,  it looks amazing.  The rounded corners I love and also the flat sides and screen just makes it all the more pleasing to look at but then there's the cameras.  I'd be limited with what I can do so I've decided to continue on with the 20 ultra for now.  Six months down the like now since the 23 release and I've researched and watched a million reviews especially on camera comparison between the range.  If you made the plus with all the specs of the ultra then I'd be sold.  Not everyone likes those sharp edge corners,  hence why you had the notes for those who did.  Bring back the ultra with the smooth,  seemless rounded corners please,  I'm loving the flat screen as it looks nicer then the curved screen of the 20 ultra but please listen to all the comments in the hundreds of reviews so far about the ultra specs in the body of the plus.  I'll wait another 6 months to see what your going to do with the 24 range.  I will say so far though you've lost out in 2 years of upgrade sales from me alone,  others must feel the same.  I like a shiny new phone every Feb like the other Samsung fans,  I don't want to go another year without upgrading 🙏🏼"

No, SD card it has 263 GB Storage I can do if I want and also I can delete some footage is not suitable, that is very work for me at least I need to change something new because galaxy note 10 it’s way too old.

"As far as we see an object with normal eyes, the objects seem far away in Samsung's camera.... So how logical is the title of Zoom being given to this phone.......🥕🥕🥕"
Cant get more GENZ than this
Such an interesting phone screen is so big and I like big screens

"most of these fake reviews are ignorant and none of them are mentioning the major screen color issue of this phone , a lot of users are complaining the less saturated, gamma , contrast screen display of S23U, its a totally downgrade screen incomparable to S21U which has a better screen display,  the amoled becomes an ordinary oled screen like other phones and samsung has fooled the consumers on this phone"
"I own a Galaxy S23 so why am I receiving advertisements for the S23? Stop trying to convince me to buy a product that I already own, you dumbfucks."
This is romel romel
Bacolod city Philippines good item
"Samsung has 3 stars in it's galaxy S series, F series, A series .❤❤❤"
Whatcha ad 😂🔥
It's EPIC BEAST.
Got a worst product (samsung Galaxy S23 ultra) from samsung...disappointed on photo clarity...😢
8 gen 2 better than A16 Bionic
samsung literally know how to make peoples amazingly awesome.with fun and style.
screen burn issue in oled phones.. that's one thing that display engineers from samsung should be fixed..
camera design looks cheap better s22 design
did Samsung shoot this video using the phone?
I think some countries would ban Samsung S series for security purposes due to zoom capability. I hope not coz I have S21 Ultra that I use for Travel Vlogs.
Can it be found in shops especially in Saudi Arabia please?
The video is super cringe
wow ! most useful
The video samsung ever released
"Unfortunately, the front camera is 12 megapixels."
This ad makes me feel like I can afford the new Samsung Galaxy. Way to go Samsung.
It even has 23 mil view
So cool!❤
RUBBISH item..... 23???? I am the ONLY victim here..... KILLERS
"If Samsung made removable battery ,3.5 head phone jack ,fm radio and memory card slot then every iphone   customer will shift towards samsung galaxy phone."
"Samsung Galaxy ultra 23.> God himself, way stronger , better , an powerful ; Than Apple IPhones which it will ""cost you your monthly rent "" an the device always improve every-year. I cant wait to grab mines. ' Galaxy for life ' lets go."

"im still trying to find
WHERE IS THE SAMSUNG GALAXY 🌌"
Watching this on my Samsung S10 Plus I got almost 4 years ago. Still a gorgeous display. I used iPhone mini in the meantime and went back to the S10.
"Probably one of the best smartphone trailers EVER!, the S23 is going to be huge this year!"
"the one thing I absolutely love about Samsung is the clean camera setup - other companies have gross camera setups on their flagships, and apple still can't lose the notch and it is 2023"
Product is good. But apple commercials keep getting better. Please catchup n smash them Samsung
"This phone is awesome, still discovering features as just got it today. Have fun creating fun contents!"
"One of my favorite features has to be the OIS. The videos taken out of this phone are so so stable, missing all those micro jitters from when usually filming with a phone, it's incredible and makes other phones with OIS feel like they ain't got one."
Super power saver
better than iphone
Def better than iphone14 pro max
"Disappointed with Samsung's Decision to Omit Original Charger Adaptor.

I have been a long-time user of Samsung products, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. In an attempt to express my discontent, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the matter.

First and foremost, I must express my disappointment with Samsung's decision to follow Apple's footsteps in excluding the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. As a consumer, I believe that every new mobile purchase should include the essential accessories needed for a seamless user experience. The omission of the charger adaptor feels like an unnecessary cost-cutting measure that inconveniences customers and diminishes the value of the product.

What truly aggravates me is that Samsung was once known for its innovation and ability to stand out from the crowd. It had its own loyal customer base that appreciated its unique approach to technology. However, by mimicking Apple's questionable actions, Samsung seems to have lost its individuality and the trust of its consumers. I find it disheartening that Samsung, a company capable of producing exceptional products, has chosen to follow a path that seems to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, this decision has soured my perception of Samsung, prompting me to reconsider future purchases not only for myself but also for my relatives and family members. I was a vocal critic of Apple in the past, but now I find myself harboring similar negative sentiments towards Samsung. This will undoubtedly be my last Samsung purchase if the company continues down this path.

I implore Samsung to reclaim its identity and listen to the concerns of its loyal customers. It is essential for Samsung to recognize that it can forge its own path and be a leader in the industry without imitating others. By catering to the needs and expectations of its customer base, Samsung has the potential to regain its status as a top contender in the mobile market.

In conclusion, I am deeply disappointed in Samsung's decision to exclude the original charger adaptor from their new mobile devices. This move, seemingly influenced by Apple, has negatively impacted my perception of the company. I believe that Samsung should prioritize its loyal customers and focus on producing outstanding products that stand out on their own merits. If Samsung continues down this path, it risks being overshadowed and losing its position as a leading brand."
"I don't understand why they don't increase the battery of smartphones sold in Brazil.
Since, in China, there are smartphones with much larger batteries.

UNIHERTZ TANK 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,500)
DOOGEE V MAX 22,000 mAh, (BRL 1,970)
OUKITEL WP19 21,000 mAh, (BRL 1,478)
ULEFONE POWER ARMOR 14 10,000 mAh, (BRL 1,018)

I think we should publicize this more so that companies care and decide to do something like this.

They are big and heavy cell phones, yes, negative point.
But if in 500 grams (UNIHERTZ TANK), they managed to put 22,000 mAh,
Samsung should be able to put 10,000 mAh in a cell phone with half this weight.
-------------------------------------------------- --------
The Galaxy M62 was released in 2021, with 7,000 mAh battery,
at the time I thought, that from this, it would only increase,
what did not happen,
later releases have 5,000 mAh.

For example,
Galaxy M51 = 213 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2020, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M62 = 218 grams = 7,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 9.5 mm
Galaxy M52 = 173 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2021, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M53 = 176 grams = 5,000 mAh, 2022, Thickness 7.4 mm
Galaxy M54 = 199 grams = 6,000 mAh, 2023, Thickness 8.4 mm

With bigger battery, it increases the weight and thickness.
For 1,000 mAh MORE battery,
increase the weight of 173 grams (M52), or 218g (M62),
for up to 250 or 300 grams, that's fine with me.

The Galaxy M54 has 6,000 mAh. Properly configured, DISABLE several features, Gives 2 days without playing, 1 day playing.

IF it had an 8,000 to 10,000 mAh battery,
weighing 250 to 300 grams, thickness 10 mm,

would be better,
MAYBE we wouldn't need to DISABLE anything
on devices that we pay dearly for."
"Watching it from my S23 Ultra, I love this phone 😍"
"dream of a good consumer, without money😢😢"
I just ordered this >D
Watching this with my S23 Ultra lol love this phone!
"Exynos will back and will destroy everything, if arrived to galaxy S24 lineup, everyone was so much love it and so happy with Snapdragon even They want galaxy s24 will use snapdragon in international, can't believe what happend if s24 will use back exynos, soc the worst always have issues overheating poor battery life worst quality cameras and not made from TSMC"

"Dear SAMSUNG

THANK YOU.... URS SAMSUNG FAN,CONSUMER SINCE PAST MANY YEARS...WE HOPE BEST FROM U AND WE DESERVE  IT...THANK YOU...AND PLEASE FIX UR PAST DEVICES....."
"can we do 7"" screen"
S23 ultra user here! I hate this phone passionately! The worst fringer print and face unlocks you will ever get! Samsung every year just focuses on cameras and forgets about the basic functions like the unlocks. This phone doesn't deserve the price tag.
"finally, a samsung phone i very much want that i cant afford"
Why Samsung has skipped on microsd slots ???
What's the name of this girl
This is the greatest ad ever.
"Samsung> iPhone.
Never had issue with Samsung in 10y"
New technology
"Just want to share my disappointing experience with the Samsung renove program :
Recently i´ve upgraded my S21 to a S23

Online, i was supposed to receive 400Euros for this Exchange.

In fact, i´ve received nothing and i have to pay 30Euros to get back my old phone.

This program is a real scam. You have to deal with a partner located in Italy who seems to have only one goal: pay nothing  !!!

Procedures are long and complicated, no help at all from Samsung who told me they are not able to interfere with their partner neither to escalate the case to a Samsung Customer representative.

Wake up Samsung customer service, i´ve bought from your website ! It´s not my concern if you choose to subcontract this activity.

So, as a long time Samsung fan, it´s the last time i buy a product from You.

When i pay 1400Euros for a phone, i would like to get a good customer service.

So, i just want to share this experience, hoping it will help to adjust your partner management."
long story cut short this process kept on happening over and over again
Creepy 😂and cool 😎
Flagship phone its mine also S23 ultra
Seeing in s23 ultra in this video is another magic😅
Fun fact the views count are same number as the S23
Me watching this on i phone 14 promax
can you add ND Filters to the cameras and which ones can one buy?
I'm not gonna buy iphone right now I want to buy this phone Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra But sadly I didn't have money for my Schooling😢
"my last Note was the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, but even then I had so many problems with the hardware and software, the biggest issue was the overheating of the Li-ion (Lithium ion) battery. I am really glad I switched to Xiaomi with their safer Li-po (Lithium polymer) battery, not only it charges much quicker, it is a safer battery technology and I don't experience any overheating of the device, also Li-po batteries can't explode;) Even the chipset Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is much faster than Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on Galaxy phones because on Samsung it uses Samsung technology and on other phones it's TSMC technology which is way better and reliable! Samsung phones are copying Apple and are loosing features but not gaining and are only good and advertising. Not a 1 billion color display, not fast charging because of the Li-ion dangerous batteries, not the best camera, not the best chipset technology, not a charger in the box, not a case in the box. Li-po batteries are safer for the environment and is the way to safe our planet, not by removing the charger from the box, chargers can be recycled and create new charging bricks, not how Samsung is saying to go buying another package with a new charger and waste paper and trees, or as Samsung is saying to use your old charger which may be broken and with slower charging than your new Galaxy phone. The most important thing is using safer and environmental friendly battery technology which doesn't explode, doesn't heat up as much and can be charged faster! The phone that I am using is the Xiaomi 12S Ultra, and I am really happy with it!"
This my fullfil
Hmmm… still not convincing me enough to move from 14 pro max.
Samsung Official Introductions are not as good as they were earlier
"I can't google voice assistant to make call and message using WhatsApp, before the software update it can.
My old s8+ for home robot vacuum cleaner  after software update , the robot vacuum cleaner app mapping features can't using it anymore. 
Software update can add features not taking away features.,if samsung wanted to taking features away anyhow, people supporting samsung smart phones will hate your brand samsung. In English people say take it or leave it!
If the software update anyhow taking features away, l will leave samsung and buy other brand smart phones. 
better take it seriously!
A day 1 people or a day 100 leave samsung after 1, 2 ,3 years you will see the total amount people leave samsung smart phones."
"Bacolod city good item more fun in Philippines,"
The dumb equipment of 700 performance better
"difference between samsung and iphone is that, samsung know that they are awesome, they make perfect stuff, so they dont need to disable their comments in their youtube channel, unlike iphone they are afraid that people are gonna abuse them for what they offer, so they just disable the comment section"
People they carry sweet memories along with them so ensure those images get stored in our cloud computing  so that they can access any where no matter which model they buy irrespective of the warranty.
Please improve the face unlock with some additional sensors.  Please
Bhot bhot bhot bkwass phone hai.....heating problems bhot zada hai....phone sala hath jalane tayar hai....bkwass bkwass bkwass 1.24lakh rs waste ho gae mt lena bhai mtlena vivo oppo lelo sahi hai
I'm positive with this phone so far.
Xperia 1 v commercial is more seducing than this
"I'm excited to get my brand new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra on July, 15, 2023!"
This is why samsung beats all the competitors
Saving up to buy S20 ultra still.. S23 is a dream. ❤️❤️❤️
Watching this on my galaxy s23 ultra cream ! Came from a 21ultra this phone is literally outstanding !! The best flagship phone on the market in the entire world
This is true 😂
The screen scratches easily. Mine got scratched by the keys in my bag within the first 24hrs aince i got it. The shop didnt provide screen protector as there was non available.
Galaxy m13 is bad at performance
"Hi samsung. I am in sri, lanka i want to buy a smart phone i, send sms. I want to buy samsung galaxy s23 ultra smartphone. It is convenient."
"Who needs a gimmicky 200MP nowadays, the sensor size is more important than those MP gimmicks, the best sensor is Sony IMX 989 and everybody knows that."
It's the worst that can exist
I just got the S23 after my S10 finally gave up wanting to go on with life. Blimey phone have come on a lot since
Me Poor guy Watching it from Galaxy A14... 🥲
Pls make small one pls...pls..plz...🤍💛💙
Good phone. But the add direction in the Galaxy line up is absurd.
Ah yes. Another intro to the smartphone that I can't afford. Brilliant
"I know you promote a lot of phones and you review a lot of different phones, but I'll never buy a Samsung directly from Samsung again. I thought spending $1,300 and buying the phone outright directly from Samsung would be better than buying from a phone provider, but I'm wrong. A phone provider when I tell him I have a problem sends me a new phone and asked me to return the old one. Samsung would like me to wait two weeks while they see if they could figure out if there's a problem and then fix that problem what would I do without a phone for 2 weeks I need to call customers I need the GPS locations I need to speak to my boss. I asked four different people and supervisors and I left messages on their Twitter page. FYI any other company when I Post a problem on Twitter's page they always get back to me. Samsung could care less. I've never been so disappointed because I have five televisions two refrigerators a tablet I must have been through six phones 5 earbuds the Galaxy S3 frontier watch, side note Samsung pay used to work on that now it does not after multiple calls with tech support, and a 360 camera. Being a Samsung fanboy has not paid off lol just want you to know because you talk to a lot of people maybe could let them know how poor services with Samsung"
"GG SAMSUNG, King of Android phone, *for now🎉"
I dont see that much difference than older models
Ssoooo for those of us who dont care about pretending to be a professional photographer what else is special about this phone. Like why would u want to upgrade from my s22 ultra? Lol
"bro, not be so happy. Xiaomi is pissing you off by their 90watt extreme charging and latest and most powerful camera lens. Don't ignore this comment. Also make the Exynos exclusive for s24 in all markets because it feels Awkard ifcolor"
"Very Sad, Collecting lacs of bucks for phone, but not giving head phone and charger....😂😂😂😂"
Thanks so nice price us dollar
Samsung I I'm a big since the A13
Iam going to buy the  phone next week on Monday
"The Samsung Ultra 23 is no t good comparison to the Note 10+. The camera is not important to me. My cell phone is not for entertainment
 I wish I had gotten my Note 10+ fixed and kept it. I am still going to buy a Note 10+. It is the best for many reasons.
I love Samsung"
"Apple is living rent free in people's minds here. 😁 😂 😂 😂

Just praise S23 ultra without bringing iPhones into these please. 🙏🏾"
please make a smaller screen version for S24 ultra. 6.8' is too big.
"So much powerful, imagine someone able to remote hack the phone and increase it's temperature making it overheat then explode."
"What's new ? in fact nothing... only normal upgrades compare to the last year device... And from an Note 10+ device, I don't have the woaw effect... neither design nor features has changes or improved.... But have to admit the price for the same performance (1100€ to 1600€)"
Z fold 4 is best 🤩
my dream phone
"I like samsung s21 ultra curved  shape
But don't like s23 ultra box type shape
That's only I see in this problem"
I love the galaxy
"Whatever, the design looks cheap, it runs Android, full of malware and Spyware, so enjoy yourself 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Samsung cameras hardware is far superior to apple iPhones’ one.
An Apple user Will regrets buying iphone
OKay Samsung Racist much? Why you gotta include the black guy last?
"I really love my S23 Ultra, but I am not a fan of this commercial lol"
I just got it a few weeks ago and have been in love with it since. ❤
"Samsung, you guys gotta get rid of the curve..it's obsolete and temper glass won't stay in tact because of it.."
I'm am glad that I now own the galaxy S23 ultra
My s23 ultra Internet coverage is unstable inside building. While my Note 20 works fine. Both using same carrier  service

"I was not planning to move on Samsung after my Samsung S10 Plus (that was a bad experience with Samsung then I have purchased OnePlus 7Pro) but was planning for Samsung post launch of S22 ultra because of the design and waited for a year to price drop. 
And now Samsung S23 Ultra launched and with the corporate offer I got it at the same price of S22 Ultra.

Loving this monster and in my office people who are having iPhone 14 Pro Max..they are asking for exchange with their device ❤❤"
Can you stop giving us curved edges please? Thank you
Samsung swinging for the fences this year 👍🥃S23 ultra all the way..
"This video pumps me up!! SAMSUNG, the best phone make(among other things) in the world"

Price is too high
"I love samsung, the color is so pretty and delicate."
I like the shade of green 💚.
Man I’m gonna buy one and start vlogging
"This video production amazing, creative"
If you have the S21 ultra or S22 you will still be able to get ExpertRAW as it was just added awhile ago
This is my first time getting a flagship model since the existence of smartphone. I swear I gonna rewatch every S23 ultra videos on youtube once I get my phone next week 🤓
At the end i thought my phone died
Hahaha... S Pen need 3 step to open.. loooong time 😅
I bought the S21 ultra and I thought of using it till maybe S25 or 26 but S23 seems really promising and I just ordered mine 😅 Samsung you're really gonna make me poor
Give me this phone
"Try next time for Samsung S 24 to look, like a smaller size S 23 Ultra. I mean the shape in the corners to be the same as the note. A smaller size Note for people with small hands, change the corners of the screen"
This was such a bad commercial. You guys should definitely improve the writing and directing of these commercials
"Samsung is W, but a ton of apple fanboys won't even ask because they hate Samsung"
I'm sorry but this commercial is just cringey asf bruh lol. Like this commercial would've worked out if we were like in the early 2000's but we're in 2023 now lol 😬😝
iphone🤮
Yes the zoom gimmick . It all makes sense now.
Best mobile in the world
We want in built photographic styles and a separate engine for photos and videos on Samsung flagship series....
200mp is gimmick
My favourite Mobile Company Samsung galaxy.❤️❤️❤️❤️
The introduction film is impecceable! Loooooved watching every second of it.
pls any one gfit me this phone
Vision booster = True Tone ?
Same phone as S22 ultra
It is S22 ultra bro
Apple user must wacth this🤣..
"If Samsung strategize by advertising their phones to at least 2 popular TV channels in every country, penetrate the media strongly, give their products to popular YouTubers, TikTokers ,Bollywood and Nollywood celebraties. People will notice they are using a Galaxy and you know everything celebraties use are always the best to the viewers so they'll want to get it. Samsung should not relax because Samsung is not apple .These are 2 different companies, apple's  home country is the US which leads the world and has the most popular stars, all of them using iphones .Rather Samsung should focus very strong in the whole world especially in Africa and Asia which are growing in population . My messages to Samsung is that they should strategize because there are huge problems awaiting them in the future. We have Oppo which only in this 2023 the brand has gotten so popular in my country due to color OS beauty and their phone design, this brand might be a big problem to Samsung in the future . We have Xiaomi though their growth is steady . We have apple which is the biggest problem Samsung is dealing with. We have vivo, realme and honor. We have the worst problem in the future of Samsung that is Huawei, Huawei is growing so fast again and it's name just make me get tempted and others too to get it even without gms and 5g ,but this brand should be the second best selling brand in my country after Samsung and it might even outdo Samsung. So Samsung do something before it's too late"
"This is not just an ad🔥so engaging, well done"
"Why its 1,25,000 rs we aren't use all features why so much cost it is. Any way phone is feeling Wow experience."
I still can't believe that Apple is so far behind. Samsung phones are almost always one or two steps ahead.
"Hey, What's new?"
ok this was pretty fun.
So basically is Recycled 🥶🥶
Me watching this video with my Samsung Galaxy S10 😢
Incredible phone but can you make a mini ultra the same size a the regular s23
"Should I go for S23 ultra or A73 5g 

Please suggest..???"
Adding Ir blaster like mi phones in the Samsung S series and also the under display camera of zte phones will make Samsung S series latest phone the most perfect.Small request to Samsung for listening to the Samsung lovers. Hope we also get Ir blaster and under display camera soon in our latest Samsung S series phone.Please make a dream come true.(Samsung)💜💜💜
This commercial is embarrassing it's so bad. Cool phone though.

Im upgrading mine i have a note 9 so excited to get the S23ultra
Good promo with inadequate resolution. Who limits video to just 1080p this days!!!
1:56 Can you send me that ?   Becomes legendary
watching this video on the same device❤️ wow
Is it even comfortable to hold? The corners are so sharp!
"Apple is a scam !!
No freedom and they sell low specs phones for double price. Always been a Samsung fan and will be."
2:33 @ThatWasEpic11
Please add the external memory card...
"Very nice trailer, well done Samsung! Still sticking to my note 9 that still going solid for God knows how long 😂"
"The gray mass pays for ecology, while large corporations do not"
Okay this is cool
I would hate to drop this phone on the floor
Love this commercial
Thank you  SAMSUNG for being consumer oriented. You listen to us a lot that's why you deliver the best:)
"No matter how expensive is your galaxy, whatsapp and instagram status update for videos ALWAYS look blur, WHY SAMSUNG? CAN'T YOU MAKE WHATSAPP SPECIALLY FOR SAMSUNG S SERIES??? 
Apple whatsapp and instagram status update are sharp and never blur.
I love Samsung but this is the only flaw you have, HEAR ME AND FIX IT"
I didnt care about s23... until I saw an ad with Changbin <3
Grateful with my samsung A 32
Where is Changbin?  thanks to him. buy a galaxy 👌
Very nice samsung
One of the best commercials I have ever seen
camera placement looks horrible. I am sticking with iPhone. Lost respect after I bought galaxy note2. side coating  peeled off
"lol every picture shown has a disclaimer ""illustrated purposes only"". so its not even the actual photo,"
A camera with a little bit of phone in it
"I wish Samsung launched a  5.4"" screen sized phone cause sometimes heavy and large phones are just burden"
Please arrange price at 150 rs
The most boring ad ever
same phone as 21 ultra with stylus - s22 ultra owner
What’s new: The Name 🤦🏻‍♂️
The trade-in value was horrible for the s22 ultra so I'll just wait m I do like the upgrade it features like the better camera and allegedly longer battery life. Not to mention the less curves are appealing. And I make commission from the sales of these from SAMSUNG.😁
Worst commercial ever. If I would watch it before buying phone I would never buy :D
What are you guys doing with your billions?
"I bought it, it comes without a recharger. Really?? For this price you couldn't include a recharger? And you had to make it out of the standard? This would've been a deal breaker for me had I known."
"Samsung is just thriving because south Korea is USA colony. It's a shame that a big entity like Samsung doesn't have its own operating system so that apps can be optimised and most of things optimised...

Also you should keep working on your own processor exynos not getting excited about Snapdragon.

We need alternatives to choose from which will make competition better.


What will happen if south Korea becomes an independent country and not USA vasal state then Samsung get banned from using Google services?

Top phone brands should have their own operating system!!!"
"2010 : hey, my phone has a camera
2023: my camera has a phone"
"So, I can travel to an another planet, through the S23?"
"It's strange to watch a video that shows a phone under sea water)
3 days ago, my S21 ultra could not stand 2 minutes under water, and the water flowed inside and the phone became unusable, and people are swimming nearby with iPhones and they are doing well with the same degree of protection as the Samsung
Samsung support said that you can't use your phone in sea water
What about this model, still can not be used with water?"
"1/ The keypad, recents and contacts icons should be in the Samsung phone app. 2/ The dark mode in Samsung smartphones should be on by default. 3/ S pen should be with a lightweight phone. 4/ YouTube app should not be inbuilt. 5/ Remove the Galaxy Store and replace it with System App Updater like Xiaomi."
"Waiting to switch over the day they change that ugly android interface. I can’t stand how it looks. The clunky transitions, crappy emojis, how unintuitive the layout is. 🤦‍♀️"
"this comercial makes me want to buy it right now, i loved everything about it and i loved the phone as well."
I like the presetation 😍
Samsung phones are the best
Just pre-booked in India. Should be getting delivered by 20 Feb. So long waiting to buy a S23

"Watchin from my ol' pal, Note 20 Ultra. Haven't upgraded since then, coz I'm a bit worried about the Samsung GOS (Game Optimizing Service) thing, which hold back the epic performance. Sh.."
Waiting for Iphone 15
0:49 only og know this game subnautica !!
Alright this was an awesome video
Is she Jenna Ortega from nexflix Wednesday ?
"This is just a fever dream, used to convince materialistic people to buy things that they don't need."
"Thank God at last Someone is doing best to compete with iPhone 
I hope Samsung makes more incredible smartphones in best price segment"
When you are high and they ask you to write a script for an Ad!
still use exynos in my?
I'm getting one at the end of the year
"I have  a21s  it was  very  good  performance  
Thank  you  samsung   company. 😘"
"I feel like am untop of the world. Mt Samsung, my super power"
"The most horrible costumer service. Bought the S23 ultra, unit arrived with a problem (okay that can happen) but after complaining immediately to Samsung, one week later still no updates, no phone, no money and they only say its the process... Not recommended at all, it's beyond bad... ATTENTION all costumers my unit came with water inside it in the form of humidity that showed up soon the phone heated up by transferring files!"
"Samsung galaxy started with: S III mini to S23 no Good. you know why, It often overheats"
Dream but I am not afford it I am poor
So s23 is camera with spen? Noice
"Finally after my note 9 did its best, i found a reasonable device to upgrade to."
"I have been using samsung phones since the beginning of galaxy, but I always wanted better color options and wanted the gold color like the iPhone 14 pro, I'm actually considering switching to iPhone just for that reason😏"
"I absolutely loathe commercials, this one wasn't bad at all. Way to go Samsung..."
Is she the one from White Lotus Season 2? 🧐
It's kinda cringe though
Send me luck to get this s23 ultra 🤤
"Samsung 
Pay more 
Get Less"
Is there still thw camera shutter lag?
wats the new buy the way?
"The most CHEESY gadget video ad.... Poor CGI, bad transitions, bad bad bad..."
Mine is on its way i already have otter box sitting at home waiting it wont be out till 17th dang it i want that external battery too but havent invented yet so hurry up samsung so i csn order that too that extra battery  life is a must but ive seen videos that this ultra lasts days but i want massive battery i have that external for my galaxy note 5 and it saves me so much time in having to worry about charging
The battery life upgrade it's what I was waiting to move back to Android
"Dead voice company
Edit YES OMG THANKS SO MUCH EVER FOR THAT LIKES
No. 101 Jan 19 2026 I said all the Samsungs in gym 2 and the Volcano
Edit YES THANSK EVER KIKES"
What's happening All brands Highly Prices increase i don't buy any basic   phone 🤔 50k + in Pakistan  2year Older phone A12 55 thousend in Pakistan markets please The Brands please Poor peoples 😢 🙏 😞
Ultra s22 (a lemon) user here.  Ultra s23 is probably another lemon!
"Samsung please keep the offer of 
Watch LTE+ Samsung s23 ultra + Buds at ₹1,30,000 in June because HSC result will be out during these days 
So that students can avail this amazing outstanding fantastic offer
Please Samsung 🙏"
good but cringe
So it comes with the stylus?
"can't lie , samsung are always innovative with their commercials"
"every year its has the most powerful processor,, what is the most powerful powerful processor"
I need money...f****************k
"** No UDC no party **  Samsung must think more laterally with sales. It can't be a ''1 phone fits all' strategy. On their site, or in the store, or both they should have 2 sections - 1 selfie lovers and 2 media watchers. The selfie lovers get a hole punch with the best selfie camera possible. The media watchers get a new improved UDC and may not use selfie at all. Come on Samsung, we don't all want a hole punch. Do this for the S24 and also please improve the charging speed to at least 60W."
What a boring update. Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the best.
I’ll stick to my iPhone.
Still the shutter lag guys. Please make it more efficient.
"When the S24 arrives  and this one gets cheaper by 50%, I still wont buy a samsung."
Hopefully it beats the iPhone 14's camera
Have a s22 ultra. Best phone ive owned without a doubt !
The real Beast 🔥🔥
"Samsung!!!
I own a Samsung mobile phone for 7 years and it still works. I use a second phone"
samsung galxy s8 and note 8 ad is legendary
"BGM at 2:38 is out of this world, please can anybody tell me where can I get its full version?"
MY used Samsung s23 Ultra.
Thanks
Where’s The Notch?? 😂😂
How much in pre order
This year will stick with s22 ultra.☺️👍🏻
Boring
"I have S22 Ultra and I thought I have a beast phone with all the advertised specifications, but the reality is not and the big numbers the specifications are claiming are nothing but meaningless numbers because my phone still lags when I use the heart sticker in WhatsApp! Don't need fooled by Samsung, they are normal phones with average performance"
Nice… but still gon buy iPhone
Samaung is doing fraud in their echange program
Lols everything is copied from iOS 😂😂😂😂 and nothing new
Mine comes tomorrow before 8pm 🤳🏼
"This is awesome, I can't wait to buy this when I have money, wohooo!! Hehe...."
Gimme one for free
"when he  said that was epic ,i remembered juan from that was epic channel on youtube 😁"
"Dont like the camera layout design. Makes it look cheap, change that Samsung."
One Day Insha Allah ❤️ I Have
What is her name ?
Nice story telling
Best Android phone to grab right now. Well executed Samsung!
Though I can't afford this phone but I'll suggest them who has ability to buy must check this phone. Best wishes for S23 Ultra !
"Can you send me that ? 🔭👨‍🚀
Thank you 😂"
Can someone tell me the name of fonts used in this video and also used in every video from samsung. Please someone tell me these fonts name.
Still in s7 edge...they are getting  better and I'm still in unaffordable margin...
"I have an S8 since 2017. I waited and waited, and raised some money for a new phone. I am thinking at S23U, not sure though due to its sizes. It seems so big, but with all the new specs and camera upgrades I do think it is a good deal. I use my phone for social media, email and a lot of photos (nature mostly and family photos). My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+). A lot of you mention S22U as being a good phone (no doubt about that), but I cannot say the price makes a huge difference between both of them, and taking into account the upgrades S23U has, I think it is worth it. Any suggestions?"
Upgrading from Note10+ to this. 😁😁😁
"If companies want to boast about sustainability and betterment of the planet, then they should just follow the release cycle of consoles. Releasing new phones every year doesn't do well for the environment. Instead like Xbox or PS they should release a phone every 4-5 years or so and with a bunch of new things and not just improving the same old processor, camera and such every year hoping for customers to get rid of their old ones and buy another phone!"
"Tbh, I personally believe that Samsung is better than Apple."
great phone
paying for brand new phone but getting recycled plastic box.
"Nightogotophy in space, I like how innovative is that :D"
Watching this in a iPhone 12 Pro Max 😅
"I like the mobile phone, but I can't afford it, thank you"
A phone without a curved screen would be the best feature ever!
Love from INDIA😍
"What's the best screen protector you guys recommend? And also case , something durable"
Will never be nothing more than IPhone clone wannabe devices 😅
3.3Kth Commented 💙
I love the camera
“Can you send me that” 😂😂😂
So this is essentially nothing more than just a night mode boost??
I already have S22 Ultra.I am big fan of Samsung. I wish i would buy S23 with exchange of S22.
Lets say. 5 months passed and iphone 14 pro max video got 25 million views but 6 days left and samsung s23 ultra got 20 million views lets say that Samsung is better
Watching on my Galaxy Grand prime. Nice 😆
I prefer my 14 pro but this is still a nice phone nonetheless.
Great phone as always. Love the design. I wish if I had money to own this beauty
what's this woman doing outside the kitchen trying to explain how a smartphone works
"Samsung is still 2 years away from apple, I mean when it comes to performance"
"Wow, such a nice phone , same specs as needed, loving this. Every thing is perfect but a small problem is that I still can,t afford. Samsung plz fix it. it should be around $100. Who agree with me 👇🏻      lol 😂"
Change the design bro😅
"could have easily stopped after the first line ""whats new? "" - ""nothing"""
Trailers are for non buyers :d
"You are very kind people give me 1 mobile phone giveaway gift
Samsung galaxy mobile phone"
"Reading some of these comments, makes me wonder if I'm one of the few people that are still real."
Rotfl... Silly comercial
"The important question to me; how does pokemon go play on it? How is the ar photo function, battery life, that stuff"
If the S series has the pen now are they even going to make anymore note series?
Samsung is just better🔥. Iphone is dead RIP💀😂😂
"hey what’s new 
WHAT IS NEW the name😐"
"hey!!, what's new......?😂"
Can the hot girl is free with this phone 💀
soo cringe
Wow i wish I could have one
"Astrography, Nightography and most importantly expensography"
In love with this commercial 🤩🤩
"Nice comercial but like there is literally no reason to switcj from my s22 ultra to s23ultra, they pulled an APPLE move and released the same phone, im disappointed"
Very very very VERY expensive.
Looks like a camera advertising than a phone. Is call quality and signal any good. Battery life?
Astronaut: can u send me that
i love watching videos of phones ill never be able to own
Still waiting for them to kiss...
I have been using S22 ultra and I see nothing new  in s23 ultra..🥱
Is there a micro SD card slot?
Sorry Apple pls away far... The beast is coming 🔥
Not the pen... there is a reason why no phone has that anymore for like 15 years
When apple asked what's new from 14 pro max 🤌
"Good job Samsung, but you can't beat Pixel's ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY!"
"I must confess I love this commercial, beautifully done and fun too ❤"
What's new? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The name I guess
***  and above all is ... cheap ! ***  🤣😂😇😛😛😛
I want to buy it... But I don't know price... How much?
"I think I need to sell my kidney to get this fantasy phone, I feel like you brought it from the future،"
Its incredible🔥.
So there's absolutely nothing new as always. I'm suprised they didn't downgraded the resolution again or remove the charger port since they removed the sd port and jack output along the years. The S10 i had is still the best Samsung i had
Is 100 x zoom is not available in galaxy s23???
I wish you didn’t remove the expandable storage.
I realy want it 🤤 ..... but I dont have money 😥
Amazing piece of marketing 👏
Ugly cartoonish camera and  same old design
Samsung garbage of the century
"anyway, iPhone is better than Samsung."
This is a masterpiece
Can you send me that❤️
Nothing's new but nice marketing 😸
Whatever! iPhone is iPhone😂
Best smart phone commerical in years. 🔥
no seriously whats new?… 💀
"Features is great but it is without a doubt, The lamest smartphone official video 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪"
This is the best Samsung commercial in decades! Make me really want to get S23 ultra.Maybe i will
Finally everyone can play Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 2 games at High Graphics on Galaxy S23 Ultra
Remember the good old days when a flagship cost only 500 euros. RIP
Over promotion 😂😂
"I never seen a phone or advertising like this before in my life
No doubt about samsung ❤❤"
IPhone 🔥
I've see nothing new here. These phones are already at their limit
"iPhone Users : We don't care about Ul because we have 3 eye camara and Apple logo. 🤯

Android Users : Apple company fooled you stupid Homosepians. 👽"
Iphone is best
Nothing can beat iPhone 😂
That's all??
Nothing new
But I like iPhone 14 pro Max 😅
"Hey Sammy, I know you know that you are sufficiently philanthropic. Please give me the S23 Ultra."
Been so long since i saw a genuinely fun intro video for a smartphone launch. Way to go Samsung. I might upgrade from my old one plus this year!
another worst samsung phone
Not impressed....👎🏻
Sony Xperia 1 v is coming
"Samsung Lover, i used Samsung galaxy A52s 5G. 8/128. 🥰"
looks like Samsung hired Marval director for this commercial shooting 😲😲
"Honest criticism - I'm not impressed.
No actually useful innovation present.

What I would really like - 10+ hrs battery life
And bring back the 3 5mm headphone jack"
"These days every smartphone’s presentation has only one thing  “ camera this , camera that, and blah blah blah about camera “. Because rest all is saturated about phones now."
"Look it's a weak male, gj Samsung at least you didn't go full woke"
"This is great, I’ve always wanted to go scuba diving."
I wish I could purchase this amazing mobile
Tell me whats the different from s22 ultra? Since i got not good experiences after buying s22 ultra.
Waiting for new superpower iphone 15 ultra😎😎😎
"I like Samsung introduction filmes like the s10 series... just like apple does... i think its better to show the product than this ""funny"" way"
"Please give me a samsung this smartphone, and I will advertise in all social networks where I am registered, samsung is the best in the world 🤗🤗🤗👍👍👍"
I have to buy it after 6-8 months later!
"By not changing the design and not adding much in terms of software, Samsung copies Apple up to the T."
"Yes, and with a price of average car in my country... no thx"
"I am huge fan of android phones but after the Samsung s21 series I have been in love with Samsung being poor, will I be able to buy s23 ultra pro, never had any this phones"
passsssssss on this my s 22 ultra works just fine just a 200 mp camera uhhhhh dont think its worthy to upgrade too and same design same size screen  and black gaps on top and bottom for the price??? passsss on this not much change at all just a camera to 200 mp overall nice new device but my s 22 ultra works just fine...
"Samsung phone exist too much bug while use, never compare to iphone"
"Dont know about the phone, this commercial makes me to buy it"
"I'm just in love with Samsung wow, this introduction alone is so special"
Exactly what's new same as before 😂😂
I can't wait
"Base S23 could now easily be recommended as the best compact phone; with S22, battery and thermal issues were big problems that held it back from getting that title and instead the Asus Zenfone 9 got it. Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way..."
What do I have to do to get one?
Not an Iphone
I'm excited for the z fold 5
iPhone is iphone
Where are the apple fansboys now 😂😂😂
"Sorry Samsung I never feel it's so new features, really it's become so funny"
I really want samsung s23 ultra 😔💔
Iam a s21 owner . Iam so hyped for this
Very expensive phone ..
"Here are some reasons why i prefer iPhone over Samsung. 
1. Battery of iPhone drains slowly compared to Samsung when in idle mode, giving overall longer battery in everyday use
2. When switched off and connected to charger, iPhone switches on its own. Samsung needs to be woken up 
3. Predictably of features"
I must pre order this
I want a mini version of ultra next year. Please make this possible SAMSUNG.
What about battery timings? Can it compete Apple iPhone 14 Pro??
"I use iPhone 12 & I really don’t feel any need to move ever to 
S22/23.IPhones are blessings❤️"
Note- the other guy was an apple user.
"Hello Samsung! 
I'm from India, can i get a S23 ultra as my birthday gift 😇"
I'm watching sumsung phone ad on one plus 😀
"@samsung 
When are we going to get new tablets"
Apple still clear 🤫
I wish i could have s23 but what can i do i am from poor family☹️
Mindblowing for real
Watching in S22 Ultra🙂
"This is so awesome!! I've ordered my S23 Ultra, can't wait to get it!!"
"Excited about the phone, but this has to be their worst introduction video for a phone !"
"Sure will get S23 Ultra 
Can't wait the year 2123 to get it 😍"
"This is a bad introduction video. I was expecting more class .
No I am not an apple fan. I just know which video stands out and which doesn't."
Disappointed.
"Not a happy customer . I have samsung  note 9 
Every time I do software update the screen turns yellowish , which was the case with most of the note 9 devices . Last time it happened I had to use my sisters verified account to tweet and get it repaired  . (Which was a long procedure for something that I didn't even do ) 
Cause even after agreeing of this issue from their end,  Samsung yet deny for the repair . 
Now its happened again . And I dont know what to do .  Not a happy customer ."

Yay! another Acid Trip Introduction since Galaxy A5 2021 Series
Dope phone but iphone is still king
Really really awesome phone ever in Samsung series
I have the s22 ultra for the past 8 months and it's awesome
Do not buy any Samsung products! They are pieces of junk that will slow down and malfunction the moment they force their software updates upon you. I will never buy another Samsung product again stay away
"Nothing is new, just a little stupid update. LoL"
With S23 Ultra u can gp to space without spacesuit. it creates a magnetic field arround u which control's the pressure of your body and adjust oxygen level even into space... just wait and see......
Never seen Samsung pull out an epic commercial better than this ❤
I wish I could so easily get in touch with a girl 😢😂
"Willing but not able
On day"
Leaving apple in the dust
"Good a commercial that finally doesn’t poke fun at iPhones, Samsung has really matured now.."
"We have been using Samsung for a long time.  This time, it would be good if smart phones have good quality for night photos.  Because the night vision filters of the Samsung camera are not as good as the night vision of the iPhone.  As Samsung smartphone customers, we are very sad"
Price in Pakistan
Hey Samsung gift me this...🙏
I feel like the guy just wanted to say hi and move on with his day...
I hope to stop using apple 😑 😍 this one is gonna be super.
I have been a Samsung user for soo long but my dream phone was S Series....... But the fact is i cant afford that
Not upto the mark
Learn something from Apple while making an ad.
What a advertising best best
Next level promotion😄💯
"It's a good camera but it overheated.. the S23 needs to be replaced, said the seller at SM Mall, so I'm really disappointed. However, Samsung released a lot of Branded products and then the Note Series, Samsung Note10 to 20 Series collapsed.  ' Strongest Cellphone, doesn't overheat../compared to the new Samsungs that overheat now, since Compisca, Samsung has changed the Note Series because other Brands that are its partner are at a loss."
The ads is yakkkk🙊
It's the black dude coming after all had been said 🙄
What kind of ad is this...
"Never give this woman a Samsung 

Ever 


Please"
"well this video hit me hard, i was a samsung user for years before turned to iphone, after 5 years using my iphone i think this is the time to switch back to samsung, really, iphone is boring,. Samsung, here i come 😍"
I was digging the universe part felt like I was there since I am high
"Thank you Samsung to be the same phone from the last year, and que last last year and going.."
Gosh I need to switch my Fold 4 to this now 🫡
"""Where's you sled?""
""Don't need one""
Thought she was going to ride the phone 💀💀💀"
Way better
Best “samsung introducing” trailer ever
So childish
"Who else thought: oh hey, Camila Cabello ?"
I used to love Samsung😢
You got one more subscriber
Pls don't mention the iPhONe here.. it's uncomparable...pls
"I will still say ... Whats new ... Nothing new in this video.. 
all same features"
Galaxy S23 is the most beautiful Samsung phone EVER !!! I want to buy the Galaxy S23 Plus Green colour 😍🧡
"as iPhone user, this is good :)"
This version will kill em all
Need to change my s9+ and note 10. I want this phone!
"It's a good camera but it overheated.. the S23 needs to be replaced, said the seller at SM Mall. So I'm really disappointed. However, Samsung has released many branded products and then the Note Series, Samsung Note10 to 20 collapsed.  Series' Strongest Cellphone, does not heat up../than you Compared to the new Samsungs that now Overheat, since Compisca the Note Series has been changed by Samsung because other Brands that are its partner are at a loss."
I'm currently using note 10 plus and I don't think I must upgrade
"I love that Samsung, unlike Apple, doesn't lock the comments section..."
When is the release date?
Watching this on s23 ultra
"Its too cheeky for an ad, seriously"
Looks the same as the S22 Ultra. Nothing new. Meh
They should add a built in screen recorder like apple what do you guys think
Boring
200 times better than iPhone 14 pro
Can't afford to buy such a high price mobile.. A kind person can give a gift 🙂
that was actually good advertisement. and the fact that samsung allows comments is enough of a shame for apple.
"If samsung is following apple with no proper design and price update, I think I've made the good decision to pick pixel 7 pro. Google as a holistic has got all in one with good design and good configuration and good price."
Watching from Galaxy S8+ user 😂😂
Hey change the back
"I can watch Aisa on YouTube, that's a lot, S23 ultra for the poor, someone can give it as a gift 🙃🙃"
"Selfie camera just 12 Mp.. 🙄🙄🙄
It's new... 🤪🤪🤪"
The beast is here
"Samsung will take the crown this year,Best smartphone ❤️"
"Sad man , sorry but lost hope on Samsung"
"As a customer i will never recommend Samsung and will never buy one again, last year i bought galaxy s22, after 3/4 month it became the most laggy phone i have ever used, fast charging doesn’t work anymore, take 2.5 hours to become fully charged, don’t even get 4 hours on screen battery backup. Started having noisy speaker, reaching out to customer service is also another worst experience, feel like throwing 800+ euros into the bin."
I swear all samsung cares about is the camera now
Back to old school. Informative and fun 👍
"The size on these phones are ridiculous, an average person can't even use the phone with one hand anymore, it seems like they are making these for NBA players."
iPhone is better
Yaxshi telefon
"After disable band selection function from june 2022 now i hate samsung phone,  it's only camera and copycat iphone"
So cool!! I think imma switch to samsung❤
did you have to make the trailer cringe ?
That's was amazing 😍
"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE SITUATION OF GALAXY MOBILE 🤗🤗🤗 ?
I HAVE NOTE 20 ULTRA, NOTE 9, NOTE 2, TAB A7 😁😁"
"Now, I can buy the s22 Ultra..."
"I loved this trailer! Just because of this commercial, I gotta change my iphone and buy a s23 ultra"
Wow that was amazing!!
Man this video is so good its making me wanna buy this phone even tho i can't  afford it 😂
Background music from IronMan first flight.
Now this was fun to watch
"Q? Whats new?
Ans : nothing😂"
Wow these phones are so great I can't wait least 10 more year's to afford one
😎 I'm an s22 ultra user now this is my next beast 🙂
It needs to be called the note
Hey Samsung ! I love your phones specially that one Samsung S23 ultra and i want that but i can't .. But in future i will. It's so fantastic 💝
Simply... nothing new
"Samsung always innovative , even is this ad 🔥🔥"
The BGM ❤️❤️
Is it like really in this video when it comes to full screen and 200mp pictures? I just find a 200mp mode for 4:3 in the camera menu
Kill the i phones 🤣
Lol can't buy this one as well😢
Who's this actress?
I WANT THIS FOR INDIAN PRICE ????????
Nothing new 😪😒
Good phone but still an incremental upgrade and too close to iPhone prices.
Mighty ultra ...
"samsung just stick to one phone for atleast 2 years , every year we regret we should've bought upcoming galaxy device 💔😀"
"Very Interesting Video,  i like it
one day i will buy galaxy s23 Ultra, my dream 🥰"
Samsung never disappoints.... Stunning phone again!!!!!
Everything is new🥰
"Hi samsung.
I have use now sm A52s but problem is here's not work auto call recording option.i need to solve this."
"*_I think it's safe to say that Samsung™ innovates MUCH more than their biggest (fruity) competitor is comfortable acknowledging._* 😉👌🏿

*_""Samsung™: Reminding 'em who's King 👑!""_* 😁🏆"
Ad is so impressive 👏
Samsung The only competitor for apple
My dream smartphone galaxy S23 ❤❤👌1TO
That's great 👍 👌
they did the APPLE THING of naming every feature 😂
Nice creativity team
full of Garbage.
Looks like an AliExpress commercial 🤦‍♂
The number is new 23 😗😗
<Iphone 😮‍💨
lop qilishniyam chichvoribslar
"Already have my galaxy s ultra green 512 gb, nice phone 😁"
This is worth the hype!
"I think it's time we got a new software design *One UI* looks terrible, specially the notification panel... yuck"
Iron man theme on the trailer 🙂
"Love this commercial !, hope that i can have that S23 ultra"
Price is not good
The flagship of flagships
The galaxy S 23 Ultra 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇰🇷🇰🇷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Airdrop is apples
How do u get that astronaut number whom you have send the photo 😜
Cringe
Honestly i didn't find anything epic about this new ultra device
"Too bad you keep putting a curve display on your high end phone... It's useless, annoying,  fragile, hard to protect, and not even appealing. Flat design 6.6 would be much better."
Good thing they fixed this low light photo/video issue this was one of the reason I ditched S22 ultra. Definitely looking forward to upgrade from S10+ to S23 ultra.
This video looks like a school project!
Does it run on 'BharOS'?
Next microwave oven
Back Housing is fragile
It's all fun in games when they are still making fun of iphone for having the same design every year
"Everyone seeing phone
Le me: Seeing the girl with his ring and earring"
Hey Samsung can you gift me this monster 😁😁😁
Hey what's actually new?😉
One of the reasons I want a new job with good salary 🤤
Nothing new just the price is new.
How bout the battery??
I hate bottom left speaker also 8.9mm thick..
There’s nothing new.
Director should be work at McDonald’s
I can get a $100 upgrade to this from my s22 ultra is it even worth it? The only thing that seams to be different is that is has a snapdragon 8 gen 2 and a 200mp main lense. Is it worth it for $100?
If premium and mid-bugged look similar why should I buy the premium? In the place ( i and you ) are different.
Bring S pen in budget like (Note 10 Lite at least in India).  Nowadays even iPhone coming in budget. Who all Agree❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍♥️💔
"Wish I could get this masterpiece..

Well...

""My low budget account says hi"""
Such a good ad in a long time
"*Most powerful processor *
Laughs in Bionic."
Dont compare with iOS camera 😂😂🤣
Samsung what’s new? Except camera downgrade and snapdragon 8 gen 2. 😂
"Whatever they produce, after 2 years you have to visit service center to change display and they will charge 1/2 of the original phone price. Enjoy"
cringe 💀
awful introduction 😐
"Have been waiting for s23 U for a year now, will get this soon . @samsung"
"Keeping my S22 Ultra, will not spend again money. We all end up using the phone for casual photos and to see some silly things in YouTube or Instagram. Hope mine last at least 4 more years"
Not bad.. for an android 😂
Literally the worst phone ad ever.
"I don't understand why you decreased the selfie camera from 40MP to 12MP. It is probably cost effective, so all S23 have the same selfie camera but still... So much money for the ultra and you downgrade the hardware? Why can't you improve the selfie camera in hardware and software like you did with the rear camera?"
My iphone clicks better picture than this…come n see
thank god i switched to apple!
That means nothing new 😂😂😂
Battery improvement is by far the best thing Samsung done this s23 ultra
I feel bad for buying iPhone 14 pro😢
Love the video!
Iphone Hard-core fans : Still Iphone is best 😼. [😑🚶]
Raw astro photography Bless Me heart ❤️
place gift me smasung s22 😥😥😩
Best camera phone 2023
Only the name is new...same old same old
I have the s22 ultra so I wasn't really impressed until it showed 1:20 Astrophoto!? The only reason I'm even thinking about upgrading already
Is this a S23 ultra cameras ad or S23 ultra phone ad!!!!….all they showed is upgraded camera features
"microSD card slot? 3.5mm jack? MST? Iris scanner? Blood oxygen measure? Removable battery? Biometrics on the back or side?
...Two-staged camera stutter button?
...No?
Okay.

Note 9 over all."
What a nice trailor
What was the game that shows in the advertisement?
Happy you finally woke up @Samsung! :)
Whats new: nothing just some Apple stuff
These days phones just sell cameras to us
Wow. that's new.
Does this phone have aptx adaptive and/or aptx lossless?
It looks just like like my 22 ultra with small upgrades idk if it's worth the money
"Same same nothing new just the number 3, but I will definitely buy this phone than any other chinese brand phones"
The new update eats so much god dang memory its ridiculous.  Its killing my fold 4 battery ao fast . You put all apps to deep sleep or sleep and it still is smashing memory.  Its ridiculous how taxing there software and bloatware is getting.
"Every year with new surprise..... Still waiting, when I get one."
Wth
CIRNGE
The best ad I've ever seen
"Cool and all but they bragged how fast the 22 ultra was and this is my 4th replacement thru T-Mobile. Lags, gets hot, charges slow when hot or says stopped due to device heating, can't use the camera when it's hot, just overall this thing picks and chooses when to work. And the battery picks and chooses when to last or die fast as ever. Dropped 30% in just 30 minutes is quite ridiculous"
"I keep using my S21 ultra. I don't need to upgrade, because nothing new or deserves to move on S23 ultra!"
We are here to just watch trailer
2:36 great finishing music 👌
Already using S22 Ultra for year. But didn't notice much difference in S23 Ultra. Decided to keep for another year. May b next year Samsung will come with new much more better features and design.
Please just give us the SD card slot back. Its not slow thats just greedy. If you gave it back it would be the perfect phone.
Soooo............ What's New ????
Simply nice 👌🏽
"Let's take a moment to appreciate samsung for not turning off comments like apple always does 👏❤

I've really started to enjoy their personality more."
nothing new
5000mah but still can’t beat i phone
wow they made this really well tbh
"Apple employees will quit their job for a cheesy add like this lol, just bought a S23 to replace my iPhone, I am shaking with nervousness."
"So braggy
Apple don't talk that much"
"Love it. this is called, what's new baby 😂. Far good from iphone."
"I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S6, which I still own. Just pre ordered mine. I'm upgrading from the S20 Plus 5G to S23 Galaxy Ultra."
"""Can you send me that"" 🤣"
Give charger at least
The Best.
"Still the same question.
Hey whats new 😂"
"I'm 3 years using Samsung phone 
It’s very Cool & user friendly"
"20% is not much, better say: ""The new Galaxy S23 contains 80% non-recylable material"". With the planet in mind! YAY"
Its call true tone😂
Is it same price as last year s22 ultra?
Love Samsung
"Same do with iPhone and  now  ultra and S23 ultra You will have to use a microscope to identify it, which will be tricky Instead of working on the phone, why are you insisting on promoting it, they could have made it cheaper and sold it with the budget they spent on the product."
Watching this on old Galaxy Note 10 Plus & loving it!
When you send pictures in WhatsApp or Instagram it will be ((((((blurry))))))
Looks like an awesome phone with a cool hype video but I love my Z Flip 4 already😄
Bro are these all paid reviews? 😂
Samsung display is worst display samsung use for there phone they get black line or colour shifting within the year and when it comes to replace there the worst price they quote
"Me: Fantastic phone, now let's talk about the price. 
Samsung: it's just a few bucks 
Me: how much
Samsung: Well, you know the price 
Me: echo"
"unimpressive, boring presentation of this phone."
Why only camera 📸
I want this 😅
i think its kind of bad time to apple and its user
nothing new
Dream phone...
So basically smartphones are camera 📷 devices with ability to make calls 🤙 (⁠~⁠‾⁠▿⁠‾⁠)⁠~
"Probably it is a good phone BUT considering the pricing differences between US and Europe it totally does not make any sense to buy it outside of US. In US seems to be 150 USD cheaper and you also get an extra 150 usd credit for the buds pro, so in total almost 300 USD difference for the same 512GB version. In Europe the preorder credit is included in the already higher price. I was intrested in the phone but I will mot buy it while there is such a big gap in price without any justification. I do not want to encourage this so  for me it will definately not be worth it. Maybe when there is the same price across the board I might take a look at it again if I will still be in the market for a new phone. Till then there are alot more equitable brands out there."
Can you make a call?
Oh !so nothing new
"me: buy it
pocket: NO....."
Now I want this even more... 😍
"This is not a Galaxy s23 , this is just a galaxy s22+."
"So basically just better cameras and new chipset and front camera decreased from 40mp to 12mp, it is kind of disappointing honestly, expected more from Samsung ."
Nice phone I like it
Didn't meet my expectations
Send me this phone for free😂😂😂😂😂
"Even as an apple fan i gotta admit,the trailer is pretty epic"
S22 ultra worth for price
There's coming another bomb 💣
"Can I use your video clip for video making purpose ?
Please reply"
so this is a gaming camera!
"My Dream S23 Ultra 🇧🇩💪
I'm Big Fan  with Samsung ❣️"
hmmm.....how i want to own one of these but then it will be super expensive .
I booking advance now😎
Wish I could buy this
Are samsungs now allowed on airplanes? Ban lifted? Just sayin
Better than iPhone 14😍🔥
"Save you some minutes
All they talk about is the processor, the materials that made the phone, and the camera"
Price in Pakistan ?
The long awaited phone is here
"As a lifelong samsung user, this is the dumbest commercial yet. Let me upgrade in case the big dipper is out. Im not sold"
"Probably one of the best smartphone trailers EVER!, the S23 is going to be huge this year!"
My dream phone ❤️
boring to me
im going to buy a new phone and i dont know what to choose whether samsung S23 ultra or the iphone 14 pro max which is better?
This phone is really something impactful
This newly masterpiece gonna rule over people's hearts. ❤️
When 90% of the phones advertisement  focuses on camera so Deep down they all are selling cameras only.
As 90kids ... I think phone is for calling ... 😄🤣😂
Nice phone but hardly any new features
I wish that this Samsung battery is very long lasting
Samsung is perfect but only thing that I don't like is battery....the phone is useless if battery draining too much
No unveil event this time?
Very disappointed with thr design 😞
The next iPhone is gonna be a car.
We need Burgundy color of S23 ultra in market. It's very nice looking.
"Yeah. Nothings new! 
Hey! Thats not true. You get some new softwares and plugins."
iPhone or Samsung these phones come out each year and are practically the same as the previous year design.
"l've been a long time Samsung user, mostly the Note series until last year when I switched to the S22 Ultra. Each year I sign up for the pre-order deals and usually end purchasing thru the Shop
Samsung app instead of a carrier. Samsung usually provides a generous trade-in for the previous year's flagship. This year that's gone and switched a carrier credit trade-in over 24 months. This doesn't work for me as I usually upgrade annually. If you do trade within the 24 months, you'll lose all and have to pay full price. There's the unlocked
version that is offering was only $500. That`s not acceptable! This should be $1,000. I'll keep my $22 Ultra until you wake up and fix yourself."
Please bring back SD CARD PHONES in the future. That was 1 of my favorite features
Please don't buy a phone if you already have one. Coltan mines are getting are out of control in Africa and this just doesn't seem to end. Think twice please
"This is the reason why Apple is winning, by giving realistic ads and promos."
I fall in love with thus mastet piece
"So cool~~!
It's finally time to free my old Note 10."
"I love you Samsung s23 ultra❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. Features outstanding, design to good 💗👍👍👍👍. Bat 💵💵👎😭."
That's it?
"Perfect, so i can buy my j7 prime finally."
Ayyyyy .... Super fun .... What a level of presentation... Mind blowing... 🔥🔥🔥👍
"Best price in india 80k to 90k
With charger adapter and card cash back they sell double the sale increase the market share also and overall profit also
Thank you"
Whats new? - its for iphone 😂
Honestly I’m making the switch back to Samsung from Apple.  I’m coming home baby!
Awesome Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
Not enough of an upgrade. I’ll wait for the S24 Ultra.
I love big screen phone best for gaming
Any That was epic fans 😎
I choose you Iphone
They used to copy apple on the ads i wish they kep that...
at least they got rid of the exynos chip
How to buy just pen😭 i want itt!
"Wait for the upcoming Huawei, i think your waiting will be worth it"
"""for Galaxy"" is like the stupidest buzz word. Just say snapdragon 8 gen 2"
Why do u think its called galaxy?😄
Coolest advertisement on a smartphone
Still i have 20 ultra and works perfectly i hope i can buy the s23 ultra son
It would have been cherry on top if Juan (from ThatWasEpic) walked in after the actor said that was epic in the last seconds.
"so... nothing new!

i am disappointed."
video still 5 years behind the iphone
iPhone 15 🔥🔥
Nothing new🤣🤣
With the new 200mp camera it'd be funny if an ad from Samsung came out and all the people in the ad were zooming in on random stuff in a picture.
im still in the iphone team sorry but thats cool too
its all fun until the phone starts saying theres water in the port and wont dissapear
I love how they all Snapdragon CPUs now. Sell the lower tier phones with exynos CPUs.
"You guys really need to find better people to do your marketing lol. Always got corny commercials for your phones. Nevertheless, can't wait to receive my S23U."
"Can't Samsung really put the accessories of the phone all in one box with the phone 
Why do I have to buy the accessories when I've already paid alot for just a phone that will be outdated within a year. They are called accessories because they come with it (all in one).That truly so unfair and against humanity why are they repeating the same disgusting thing that apple did. I really loved Samsung so much and I don't think they should disappoint their fans just like that.
They say they are considering environment hey really man ! Instead of get it all in one box 📦 
I am buying a phone in a separate box
The charger in another box
The headphones in another as well as the USB and other accessories 
So how can this be considering the environment. 
I just hope Samsung could reconsider their actions and consider humanity"
Can't afford.... 😥
5000megapixel camera when????????
"P1 : hey what's new ?
P2 : the name ."
This is actually such an elaborate and fun introduction film. Nice job. My s23 Ultra is already pre-ordered!
"Nothing new hhhhh
Samsung is a big trickster"
"What should i do to get one of this  @Samsung ? xDD 
"
booring same design though
I am watching this on my mighty Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
"Everything looks perfect but i don't like the length and width ratio, apple mobiles look more attractive because of perfect  ratio."
Send 1 fully packed s23ultra to me
Is there improvement in the heating  to the phone with 5g?
"Am NOT so sure about that Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 ""for galaxy"""
@Samsung ok give me some money so i can buy a new Samsung Galaxy s23
Dream one❤️‍🔥
I have to admit that this focus on the camera including Astro photography and low light seems pretty great.
can’t wait for mine!
"I I have note 20.ultra , and I am worried about its display, issue something like gluegate/display burning issue.
Worst service by Samsung, no more samsung."
I will buy this twice but not Apple
Not only they running out of ideas for new phones but seems like they running out of ideas for advertising their phones too.
legit scary
Can Minecraft work in this phone on hight graphics ?
"Mocking iphone by saying ""what's new?"" 😂"
Nothing new😇😇
This is my dream phone❤️ i hope one day i can buy this❤️
Is this the best smartphone ad ever or what
Alright you got me.ill wait for the S 24 ultra so the price will go down a little bit. S22 ultra owner here. I love the s23U tho ☺️
"Nice, this was a fun video! I may upgrade this time."
what is different from s22ultra?
I think Samsung galaxy s23 ultra is going to haiyer selling smartphone in the whole world 🌎
Soooo basically nothing new....ok
Looks like they pulled Apple moves and did stuff only to the camera and the other thing that's always new is the price
I’m really gonna get this:)))))
My favorite choice for always ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you Samsung 😊 🙏 😘 ❤️
Basically everything is same🤣
Yep um sorry but the s22 n s23 ultra's design is ugly i find the s21 ultra and the xiaomi 12s ultra as being the most beautiful designed phones in the world. Their designs are like nothing i have ever imagined👌🔥❤
Samsung greatest boss and king in the world
Never beat iphone😂
Nice I love the ad
Watching this in my Samsung note 10 plus ultra....
"the ""can u send me that"" fancy words...apple has that for like 10 years"
"I love s23 because of gen 2..
I 'm going to the store.."
Watching this on my s20 plus 5g
Why are people so obsessed with camera on a phone
"So the only difference from the S22 Ultra is the new 200MP rear camera. But they've downgraded the front camera from 40MP to... 12MP? Why on earth would they do that when selfie cameras are in many cases used more than the rear? Bored of the front cameras being neglected now. Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time. I'd honestly prefer them to just release a new model every 2-3 years so the upgrades between each are actually worth it. No battery upgrade in the S23 either. Again, love the Ultra series! But make the upgrades worth the money please Samsung!"
i will stick to my s22 ultra. nothing new. just an advertisement for increasing sales and profit.
Can’t beat APPLE still….
"I wish I could get a free Samsung s23.
I am just a student pursuing medicine 
And I have no money but have big dreams."
I wish I could get a free Samsung s23 .
End of apple
Apple will take a decade to innovate such features and they will call it futurestic.. lol 😂
Samsung S are now become the perfect phone. Literally no complain from past 2 year.
"WOW and in 2 years it wont be worth buying, just as all before it!"
"I hate this AD already, could've done this 10x better but still love you samsung peeps"
Retro? Old–fashion? Nice phone but really boring script.
anyone like me who doesn't have the money to buy but are you watching? 🤣
I ordered it yesterday!
cringe tho
Samsung ads never disappoints. This was so entertaining!
I need this one:)
"Whats new
Samaung, introduces new vocabulary"
I just wish the phones were a little smaller. I still have my S10e because all the new models are so big.
Uauuu...the best.
I'm waiting for s25 because now I have no money 🥺
Very good design and awesome features.
Where is bts
can someone give me this phone my dream android phone. 😭😭😭
This introduction was amazing I think it's time to leave my note 10 plus
In parallel universe.. I'm still fine with my Galaxy Note 8 (Ultra) enjoying watching S23 Ultra !
Can I have one for free Samsung plzz🙏🙏
"Okay!!!
This was freaking 'Epitome of Epicosity'."
Still no headfone jack ?
I'm disappointed. Where's the part where you target apple?
Funfact: Free Lightroom advertisement 😁
Cringe
You missed the brand new 10x telephoto intro!  😂
Very lame ad. The features are not bad.
"I think the one problem is
that they should improve battery life when caching lots of datas and using max power"
This is so beautiful galaxy Samsung S23
Nothing is New Everything same like 20 21 22 😂
Who is she ?
Hello Sumsang. I am currently using Galaxy tab A7 lite. Consider me for the epic gift🤩
Good Morning Good Night Samsung 
One day i will buy Samsung ultra phone in my life by my money
Nice loop at the end
*Nothing special*
Always the same thing can't order via the oficial site  is giving and error and CS told me is a glitch that keep trying an didn't help me. Last year off Samsung will wait on the Pixel 8 pro and change. Bought the Pixel 7 Pro for my kid in 5 minutes..Via the oficial site no issues quick delivery.
if cringe marketing were a YouTube video
Samsung is becoming apple..
"It's time to say goodbye iPhone 
S pen 🖊️🖊️🖊️🖊️ ❣️❣️❣️💥"
"Revelations 3:3, let us Repent Jesus is coming"
Maybe I'll still stick with my S22 Ultra 😁
"I was into S22 ultra but now...
What I should to do!!!!!!"
Are they producing phones or cameras...??
the trailer is so good :o
Same old UI. Still now faster than apple silicon
"Dumbest commercial ever, my God! That was painful to watch👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
iPhone child Samsung is dad not compromise to Samsung Galaxy S23 ultara 😎
At least the comment section exists unlike some other brands.
Very cartoonist
Boring
I heard this is the perfect  gaming phone for samsung fans! !
I will buy this phone when I became a rich man 😅😅😅
It's epic
"The S23 Ultra is a truly amazing phone, but remind Samsung to never make an ad ever again."
"I'am not happy with Samsung Camera it's too over exposure far far away from real Colour. I'am are fabric businessman I'am using Xperia before and no problem with Colour but after using Samsung it so difficult to get real Colour that mact with the original. Every single foto is over exposure too red, too green, too much from the reality.
Ugly boy become hansome boy, now I realize why more people like Samsung its because to fake.
Can you make real camera that mact the real Colour? I'll waiting for sure coz Sony is long time gone from my country"
How To make your iphone faster ⚡🔥.   Follow me for more
Best commercial ever by Samsung 🔥
Way better than iPhone 14 pro max💀💀
I am a poor man i cannot buy it😪😪
Where are  🍏 fanbois🧐🤣🤣
Coming Soon with Ukulele string screen 🤪
This is boring introduction video
Who loves dirty Samsung phones?❤🎉
"Watching this in 144p, it's like introducing the Galaxy S2"
"Killing all king's and today Samsung is in my top list , What an power 🔥"
"Love this next level commercial, looks like we are in the future right now! ❤❤"
The advertisement is catchy and fun to watch. Watching from my s22 Ultra
Wow its a beautifull smartphone 📱📱📱📱📱📱
"I am a regular  fan and customer of Samsung.  I think a slight yellow tone is in the photos captured with the s23 ultra but it uniquely beat the all other smartphones with speed, camera,  color."
One of their best commercials
It’s awesome phone...
Watch on galaxy s20🥺
Watching it on iphone 14 and glad i don't fall for it.
hope you can get this handphone
They copied Iron man
Me: too rich to watch this ad. But too poor to buy one.
It's pretty much the same as Samsung Galaxy S22. Not much of a huge difference and upgrade.Except for it's camera more powerful and bit more extra features. Otherwise both the series and model are pretty much similar. S22 and S23.
now give me a free one
"Still using S8 with A2N kernel.
But awesome promo video!"
😂😂😂 Apple are best
Same as last year 🤣🤣
whats up with this childish commercial 🙂
"That's it, I'll keep my s22 ultra and wait for the s24 ultra!"
no this is.. really just drama because nothing much change
Sorry but no big update. iPhone got more upgrades.
Waiting to get a job just to buy this 💙
Yes. Actually What's New?
iPhone’s iphone
Why always overpriced
"I just love how the sync or union everything with each other ❤
I have been using Samsung specially the Note ""Ultra"" line for more than 12 years.
They only need to make the charging time as fast as the chines phones.
I have the tab S8 Ultra, S22 Ultra, Smart watch4 and I'm thinking now for the Samsung Book Ultra but I can't afford the price now 😔
wonderful Unpack show ❤"
"Eagerly waiting for this! Gonna be my first flagship phone.
Just waiting for it to be launched in India"
Finally a king galaxyis back  After s10+ 855 ...
Very expensive for nothing
"I think I can speak for everyone when I say, THIS WAS AN AMAZING, WELL EXECUTED VIDEO, showing us what’s new about our life companion!"
I miss the days when 3min wasn't enough to introduce all the newest stuff in the phone
"Apple: we have a brand new design
 Rotates camera*"
Another Samsung phone
"1:57 ""Can u send me that"" got me🤣🤣"
"There must be something about the youtube algorithm, it shows me all iPhone ads, but did not show even a single video of the new Samsung phones!"
"Hahahahaha lol, nothing special, It seems like my twins😳"
"This is so 🥺. For now, I can only afford Xiaomi 12t pro."
"Bought it. Will get it on Feb 17th. But if you plan on upgrading from S22 or S21 Ultra. Just DON'T. There is no point in doing that.
And if you plan on buying it, do it NOW. I got 25w charger + Wireless charger + Watch 4 Classic LTE 46MM + Buds 2 with the phone. 

The only 2 upgrades with S23U over S22U is 200mp sensor and Snapdragon 8 gen 2. Everything else is borderline useless/gimmicky/situstional.

We aren't gona spend every day taking pictures of stars and moons."
I almost fell asleep watching that.
"SD Card .... Bring it back SD Card 
 Bring back removal storage 
At least Give customers the option"
Whats new ..???  Increasing price.....!!
this is all about flexing your phone 💀
Always I loved samsung phones...
I’m too stupid to know what any of this means but I feel happy seeing a commercial have fun
Bruh!!! You made me to hate apple........
I like thiss
Again they missed action mode
Ummm. That’s it?  Just cameras.  SMH.  Sad commercial.  But do like the phone. Maybe spend a little more money and produce a more powerful commercial.  It just lays flat.
oh my gosh so much of creativity in the phone as well as the ad so so so so awesome ❤️ if u have this no need of any iphone or something Samsung is a wholesome ❤️
Most cringiest commercial ever
"Nahhh ,just same with s22 ultra except for SDG2 chip... thats it.."
Iphone users now🥲😭😢
Still s8 had best commercial
"Really weird ad. ""Here, let me showcase the power of the pen: by showing how it can adjust sliders."" ""We're underwater?"" Gonna showcase some sort of waterproof technology or underwater camera technology? Nope, environment-friendly stats. ""Now let's showcase processor speeds."" Have some segment on a motorbike like some sort of VR/AR tech. Cringe."
One day for Sure
Was waiting for samsung to release S23 for a long time n finally s23 is out n it's crazy man... Hope I can afford to buy my dream phone one day...
Say made to order but shown out of stock. some joke
Woooow its amazing 😍😍😍
I’m not the only one watching this on a iphone right?
"500$ trade in for the S22 Ultra is god awful. Used to upgrade every year , not this time"
She literally holding a bomb
"Everything is repetitive!
1- The back design could be more attractive. (one very large lens and two small lenses)

2- The user interface can still be improved. The user interface has not reached the level of maturity that
Like iOS, only its infrastructure should be improved. The IOS user interface has matured.
So I think now is the time to rethink the design and not the infrastructure of the OneUI user interface after several years. (Square icons with rounded corners, the details of the icons should be increased, the symbol of antenna and battery in the notification needs to be changed and redesigned after 17 years)

The only thing that is great is the hardware and build quality.
But everything is repetitive and this is to the detriment of Samsung because it forces less buyers to buy it. There is nothing new!"
All time Favourite Samsung 🇵🇰💕💕
Cringe
Wow! Impressive
Now that's a really EPIC commercial right there Samsung!
"this commercial is AWESOME!!!
love it 😍"
I’m watching this on my iPhone 14 pro max 1tb paid in full cash
Sooo it is made on recycled materials then sell it 20x the price? Ohh yess samsung all the way
After watching the samples there are some great improvements to video and night time video! For now great job samsung!
What's New what kinda ish is that 🤔 what's new my **S.
Too bad I'm too broke for a new phone lol. Still using my Galaxy S8 🥲
"Love You Samsung 
🦋🖤🦋🖤"
Where is the charger? You can't give us something new without a charger
Nothing much improve from s22 ultra gonna wait for s25 ultra
Can anyone tell me who is female model?
That's the epic
"Never think that Samsung is a Company. 
Always think, it is a hub of Innovation and creative thinking."
"Meh, not convinced. I'm happy with my s22 Ultra! For ASTRO photos I'd rather use a real digital SLR camera with interchangeable lenses and a tripod."
"@Samsung, Can I get the s23 Ultra by trading in my Note 10+? Been using Samsung since 2010. Every year I bought a new one. But since 2020 didn't upgrade. 
What do you say ?
Thanks"
That's the real king
"Micro SD card slot, bring it back."
man is this comment section rigged ..paid commenters everywhere....its literally the same phone as s21 and s22 ...
So much fiction
😭😭😭😭 i want one love you samsung❤❤❤❤❤
A little Nemo reference 😂
"Hello, Humans
The road you take, is meant for you. Don't worry about what road other humans take.

TERRANCE OUT"
"thanks,im fine with my iphone 13 pro max though lol."
That quick share feature was the best they sending feature they added. Bruh sending files through Bluetooth used to take 2-3 hours. Quick share sends files in 10 seconds
What’s new on this phone ?
There's nothing new tho
"This is my dream to buy a phone with this kind of features please bless me so that I can buy it, I am 20 years old"
U can get inside the phone WOW
"The only comparisons you can do is iPhone Camera vs camera, for everything else, Samsung for the win."
Nothing new here just a minor updates I'm not impress
Love you Samsung ❤️❤️❤️
"I love the fact that Samsung is a proud supporter of free speech when Apple won't even allow you to comment on their content. Samsung, not CENSORSHIP!"
I've already gotten tired enough of Samsung bloatware annoying me that I'm definitely getting a pixel for my next new phone. If only the EU would make a regulation requiring all apps on a phone to be uninstallable :-).
Cringe ads
If only it had an expandable memory card slot.   I would fill the internal storage in no time with 200 megapixel images
Get memory SD/ micro back .
"wheres the sd carddd , the new cameras are welcome though"
they've jumped the shark
S21 ultra ruined samsung for me. Will never buy another samsung.
Nothing is really new its just an improvement of the last model...im waiting for a more game changer phone...samsung havent advance the game yet..Iphone can still surpass this phone...
whats new ? camera and processor thats it
"They're really stepping up their game in their introduction videos. Instead of having some person narrate the things that are new, they show you with people having more of a conversation in more imaginative environments. Though I do like that commercial that shows how their SSD isn't made of soap lol"
@ThatWasEpic
looks like a phone can it send text
Is that a camera or does your phone got acne
Cool advert!
so basicly nothing newer than the old samsungs
finally! Now I can buy samsung galaxy s8
Omg ..Samsung you've killed me with this one . Its the one of the finest phones in the world..will buy this ... btw proud owner of Samsung
Why isnt verizon offering the 1tb?
"The video is cool but this doesn't really bring anything important that I don't have on my S21 Ultra.
Hopefully by the S24 we'll have an assistant AI, since you guys built an NPU in."
"Galaxy member since Galaxy Edge 7, i have s22 ultra i'm so happy, but i change My phone every 4 years so SEE ya in 2026!"
No more Samsung  phone's the S 20 will be the last one over priced and terrible phone dial by it self and fingers recognition  have to reset time  to go back to other companies 🤔😉
The best..the amazing phone in 21 century..good luck Samsung galaxy 23 ultra..😍😍😍😍
S23 Ultra have Inbuilt Call Recording or not?
"So, nothing new...
When will they fix my S22 Ultra from randomly crashing and rebooting?"
Brilliant!!!
Please just put 10 cameras on it and be done
"""Hey, what's new?"" Me: The price increase?"
Beast💪🏽💪🏽
That astrophotography?!?! I NEED IT!!!!
No SD card?
It looks the same as the last one. Please stop churning out phones every year you're creating SLAVE CLASS in the Congo.
Next year will see now have 22
WOAH OH MY GOODNESS I'MA NEED TO ORDER ONE ASAP
Bro this is soooo dame cheesy they changed nothing but the processor for the most part and I thought the apple was bad with marketing they r trying to look more like a I phone more every year trying to make the icons resemble apples boxed apps soon it’ll be called the pineapple phone 😂 these phone companies lost it when it comes to innovation does no body remember the droid from Verizon or the blackberry storm 1/2 the first I phone in 2007 they changed the smartphone world completely so much innovation back then now we get the same product in a shiny new color and told it’s better smh so sad
Okay this was epic!!!
I love Samsung phones 🤩
Not gonna lie best phone ad i have seen in years acturally had thought out in it
"taking galaxy photo using galaxy phone, this is incredible!!!!"
"I don't know why I laugh about this commercial. HAHA. This is fantastic! Well, I look forward buying this thing or S22 Ultra since there is only slight difference haha"
So incredible 😍 I am samsung fan but the most I like camera 📷 🔥
"Mine is coming tomorrow, can't wait!"
S22ult is a BOOM last year so many ppl expecting much for this! will be there any significant upgrade..?
What's so different from previous entry?
"Worst experience with Samsung mobiles lately. We've been great fans of the Galaxy Note series (me) since Note 3 while my wife of Galaxy S series (both flagships). However, lately esp since Note 8 and S20 onwards their hardware and support standards have really taken a dip and I mean big time. While these flagship devices are ever more expensive however their reliability is worse than ever, they hardly last 2 years in service and if they survive that afterwards they become extremely slow and increasingly unsupported. To top that, Samsung runs out your support clock quicker than any other manufacturer. Unlike iPhone, the Samsung flagship devices stop getting latest OS sooner than all other competitors. Recently, their displays start to get green lines which is a death sentence to your phone's display as after first line your display lasts a few months at best. Also, the processor will start to age and become sluggish, while battery star to die on you by half the backup compared to when your phone was new in just over 2 years, I can go on n on... Last but certainly not the least, their support is pathetic than ever, even within warranty period they waste their customer's time and money in lengthy and dismissive repairs if they accept a warranty issue at all (mostly their support tends to reject warranty issue as misuse or damage by user). Outside of warranty with problems like spontaneous appearance of green lines on display or other hardware quality issues will be out rightly denied any support. Summary, I'll never waste my money on Samsung mobiles again."
I wish the z fold4 came with flagship cameras...hopefully the fold 5 will
wow camera got phone features
"Love the phone, but this is a terrible promotion."
Well that was fun to watch
what happened to the first 22 astronauts?
Just preordered it... can't wait to have on my hand...
I buy but still i am on land it didn't bring me to the space
I don't care if it's the same phone with similar characteristics as last year's... I like Samsung
so perfect But I continue to use the same s22ultra device. wait for next year Might be more useful.
Want exynos more powerful than other processors
Can you give me one as a gift? For a Samsung fan🥺🙏🏻
Yet another expensive phone that people will buy keep for less than a year and buy the next one that will be even more
Can i use this phone for crystal clear voice calls ?? 😉
Super brawo dla firmy samsung
Come on iPhone lovers 👏🏼👏🏼😅. Whatever still iphone is best for me.
"Why s23 has Only x2 Exclusive Online Colours “Lime/Graphite??. But the “s23 Ultra” has x4  Exclusive Online Colours, Red,Lime,Graphite,Blue??😮 this unequal Colour Online Exclusive Colour Choice Option, is “Stopping” me purchasing S23.😢"
I want one 🤤
This is the most beautiful ad I've ever seen. It's so fun 😊😊
"Samsung really did it in this one, with their commercial 👏👏👏"
so they left out the black guy till the end? This is not woke enough! Also why does the white boy keep questioning a woman?
i need ultra 22 phone who can give me by free ??
what a horrible advertisement
"Meanwhile me watching this on a BIG epic notch screen😢😢
I really wanto switch to SAMSUNG😍
Can you gift to me Samsung😉"
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra puts iPhone 15 Pro Max 5o she 9 months before it releases.
Now I'll either sell my kidney or my GF for it
finally good time to buy s22 ulra ;)
No one cares 🤣
I can't wait for the s23 ultra and the s23 ultra
Nice technology camara is unbelievable super
"I m so much love wiht the add.

The best one.

Hye can you send me that.

Night vision ✨️"
"What's new 
I broke my Galaxy J7 prime for the fifth time today  and I can't even make sure if I did type this comment correctly even because I cant see it !"
I can't afford this but I can love 💕🙂
This commercial is silly but I am excited about the S23 series. Its hard not to want to buy one because I already have the z flip 4 but same time these phones look amazing
I buy this in 10years when its affordable 😦🫨
Samsung is best phone
Waste of money
This is quite possibly the dumbest advertising video. I’ve seen in a long time.
"Why video is 1080 resolution ?
it must at least 4k"
"Hey What's new? Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
Make me Goosebumps ☆(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*"
I’m still waiting to hear what’s new
More useless and unnecessary technocrap.
I'm going to buy  s23 ultra this coming march 2023😍😍
What's the difference between this one and the s22?
I think I'll put my iPhone aside to experience this beauty
Nice video edit and idea of marketing to present details.
"Can't advertise with a case on.😅
PUT A CASE ON IT!!!"
"Still s8 ad is the best
A s8 user"
"SD 8 gen 2 more powerful than a15, and close to an a16"
East and West Samsung Galaxy is best
"I'm looking forward to this 100x zoom , space zoom or moon zoom whatever smasung advertised with this stuff. 30x zoom on the s21 plus I can snap pics perfectly of the moon it's amazing so I can't imagine what the s23 ultra with these new features can do."
Who cares about the phone when the commercial is actually soo good😂
Basically s22 with upgraded proccesor and cameras. Samsung is becoming apple.
Wow s23 ultra
"The best way to shoot quality photos with the new Samsung Galaxy S32 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode and then scale down the size to 4000 x 3000 pixels (12MP, 4:3 aspect ratio) or crop the latter to 4000 x 2250 pixels (9MP, 16:9 ratio). This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The default 12MP photos of S23 Ultra are oversharpened and unnatural."
"So they got rid of the ""Note"" name and are calling it S23 Ultra instead"
cringe
"Bad phone, bad ads, not interested"
"Green is the worst looking colour ,go with cream."
Bit of a silly advert imo
"You had me at ""Can you send me that?"", not gonna lie."
Apple learn something from Samsung
Then it caught fire 🔥……………
Cringe. Anyone? Yes? Thanks
Using S series from S3...Just have to make saving for this one 😇
I want this phone
that is awsome 😍😍😍
Wished I got it for free
Nothing new
Admn samsung can you give me this phone in the video for free ? 1/ yes 2/ no choose number?
Love Samsung ❤️
This ad could’ve been better..
Still rocking the best phone Samsung has EVER made: the Note9
You can't white wash the waste you're releasing your product by minimal update increments.
samsung+snapdragon = wombo combo perfecto 🔥🔥🔥
Nothing New🤪
Astronaut one is funny 🤣
It’s cool that Samsung has its comment section on for their new-phone videos unlike Apple…
Pure cringe
How to get it free @samsung
The worst ad can be!
What's new ..
It's the same phone. They're pulling an iphone
"Impressive introduction video, how about the battery ? Is that any improvement and not overheating easily? Not a sarcastic post, am a S series user from S2, S6, S9+ and now S21 Ultra, all functions are good just battery easily dropping and sometimes might overheat and need shutdown for cold down."
Watching this on my a71 maybe someday I will have money and buy the S series
Galaxy s23 ultra = price of one kidney
"This is the remaking of the ""Friday"" song"
If i had a gf like her i would dump her in in an instant
This ad is absolute Cringe! Designed by non-popular high school dorks
MedMen Stock Sky Rocketing Today! Best Brand in the Industry. BUY MMNFF stock today........
Take that apple!
advertising on another level
I have S8 and wanna upgrade to S22 ultra. As there is no big difference between the both..
Too square. Square corners need to round of like the regular S23... would be better if it have the S23 plus design.... with s-pen along with the Pro cameras.
All things has been copied from iPhone 14 pro max
It's incredible that Samsung Galaxy is taking pictures of real galaxy 😘
I just kw the S24 is gonna have that new chip samsungs been working on can't wait for them to beat iPhone performance
We now buying silly upgrades which are supposed to be updates for extra money eish
They still haven't answer the question.What's new?
Another copied from pervious version
Respect the fact that Samsung allow comments on their videos so you can see other peoples perspectives. Unlike 🍎
THIS IS HOW  A COMMERCIAL SHOULD BE…!!!!!
Definitely amazing smart phone
"I'm still using Samsung Galaxy Note 9 ❤️ with a broken glass😞 but that's not a problem👍, I'm still having fun🤪❤️
Love Samsung ❤️❤️❤️🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩"
"Welp, guess I'll be keeping my S22 Ultra for the next 6 years. I see no reason to upgrade especially with the price tag being Exactly the same at 1200 USD. and that's both s22 ultra and s23 ultra  with 256 gb."
"I got it. so nothing new besides the name, thanks for explaining that with this video"
Very nice . After 4 months you need to charge the battery twice a day 🤣
At this point call it a pro camera instead
These days i dont know whether smartphone adv or camera adv... cumon broooothhhaaa
S 21 ultra and my next one will probably be the 23 ultra in a year or so
Cool
Brilliant Phone 📱
Does this one also comes with the Green Sword??
Cream or green  Which one....??  I'm confused....
"Still using  6 years old smartphone which can play games , browse web and videos, Still doesnt see  a point for buy 1000$ phone for doing same thing which my old phone is doing"
Imaging hitting on a girl and got kidnap into the ocean
"Meet the new boss. 
Same as the old boss.
I’m STUNNED that Samsung can’t produce anything exciting anymore. It’s a sad time for technology. 
What are you laughing at Apple? 
You’re no different. 🤔"
And I'm here waiting for any Youtuber to giveaway this since I'm being a fan to them always.
"One of the worst samsung phone Introdutions ever. Good phone, bad video."
Send me this for review plzz
Nothing has changed since previous version 👎
"well, after watching this video i realize there isn't actually anything new. improved ois, improved nightography, vision booster and environmental friendliness for marketing. telephoto same, display same. and nightography and vision booster are just software improvements that could be offered as an update to s22 ultra, but that won't happen, people shall pay again to get something they could already have had last year. s23 ultra is just an s22 ultra in which the deliberate shortcomings have now been eliminated."
The astronaut 🤣
This was way better then I was expecting! I might upgrade from 13 pro max to S23U just because I prefer Samsung
Everything is new inside that what matters design is already cool
THEEEEEEEE S2333 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Copy of S22 Ultra .. 
Waste of money ."
"Absolutely disappointing.
No new innovation, no new designs.
Just update of see ultra .
Thums down"
Finally
The new Galaxy S23 Ultra also allows you to hook up any stranger whom you've never met in your life for a 3 mins explanation of how good it is !
It makes me think the S24 Ultra will be completely different. The fact they've basically kept the same design and just changed the camera quality and storage capacity makes me think hmmm what will the S24 Ultra look like? I'm keeping my S22 Ultra love it. Still have my S10+ and S20 Ultra
Same design square and 3 hole camera..boring smartphone ever on  android era..not like symbian..now the phone only show off the camera first..really boring!..more beyond thecnolgy more more boredddd..
Since I am watching this I don't have money to purchase this product 🥲🥲🥲
Just incredible like always 🤩☺️🤩
Still not as good as my Samsung Galaxy S8+
OMG! White people are back in commericals!
Pov : if apple  comment on this video
Sitting in a Green screen 😂😂😂 just act like in a space 😂😂 with out spacesuit 😂🤣😂😂
Only if my salary is 1 lakh then I can buy this one 🥹
cry in the corner with my S20 FE
haha they mentioned that was epic youtube channel lol
"Because few years ago Huawei tell the Samsung Galaxy can't see the Galaxy, and now u make this... 😁"
So this phone is better in the USA and worse in the rest of the world. I don't live in the USA so I better move on with Pixel or iPhone
"Nothing really changed, the same exact phone from 2022, shame on you Samsung"
"Where to experience the best performing features?  It will be available in this S23 Ultra
 Samsung Galaxy 🔥💜☄️"
Why make this look like the s22ultra🤨
Dangggg!!! I'm an iPhone user with a 13 Pro Max ever since Samsung ditched the Note series!! I was a total Note fan since I was a kid & was to buy the latest Note when i finish my school then they ditch Note! (2021). So I went with Apple BUT now mannn I wanna turn back again kinda. This is truly nxt lvl!! Especially so far the coolest Note ad I've seen! Brings back so many memories... I think this is the one of the top 10s best ad's I've watched...! thank you Samsung <3
OMG!!!!!!!!!samsung while I was admiring all the incredible phones that you have been releasing and now this amazing phone is wow!!!!!!💜💜💜 I wish I had it and I will one day ...... keep going on like this samsung you are the best 😍💜
"one of the worst introduction videos, I've ever seen..."
You will never be more popular than the iPhone.
Another gimmick like how to tried to proved s22u is an amazing phone but it was fcking regrattable to have it. S22u will be my last samsung phone. Switching to iphone.
vision booster was already on iphone> true thone
My favorite phone company I am buying samsung s22  because it is beautiful design phone Samsung smartphone software is very Samsung software is very  interesting and it is safe
Samsung can come hit it raw 😍💦
Okay let's do the trade-in again from my S22 Ultra. Looking forward to that astro raw. 😇
Vision booster already there in iPhone what’s new 😂
samsung beat apple video plz
"I like this ad, now I know what I can use the features for. I'm using S21 and probably want to upgrade to S23"
I'm seriously considering now that they dropped the exynos chips altogether.
"envious of the SD 8 gen 2, from my s22+. though the battery here is also very doable, can't imagine how stressfree it would be with the s23 series in terms of power backup"
Samsung has the best marketing team of all smartphones.
"Dear Samsung! I would like to ask you to make some important changes in your software. 
1. Add the ability to import passwords from browsers (chrome, edge) to Samsung Pass. Currently .csv files are not supported in Pass. I have to transfer all the passwords manually when switching browsers to Samsung Internet.
2. If you enable autofill passwords from Samsung Pass instead of Google Pass (which also works sometimes) - then the autofill codes from sms disappears. Please make a normal autofill codes from the sms by means of software from Samsung.
3. Make Samsung Pass support available on Galaxy Book computers.
4. please make the Samsung Internet browser and the branded email application for PCs missing. Your EMAIL app on your phone is perfect. It would be cool if you made them on PC as well. The Chrome browser extension is no substitute for full use of Samsung Internet, which would sync both bookmarks and passwords (similar to syncing between mobile and PC chrome or edge browsers). Your smartphone browser is actually more convenient and functional than chrome. But it becomes inconvenient to use it when you often need to use the browser on your PC as well."
So many bots telling people this phone is great but no one has it yet
Great 😍
The new leap for smartphones would be 3d projector gaming. Ar projected videos
"u know when the phone ""upgrade"" is boring when u see a lot of robots on comments section."
"I don’t see any difference with S22 Ultra...😐
Loser...👎🏻"
Bro i am an iphone user (13) and this convinced that samsung is an upgrade from an iphone
Expected increase in fast charging
Apple has better ads. But Samsung has better phones. :) sorrynotsorry
Okay you know what i'm thinking right now.... iPhone should come and watch this commercial
"what a phone is that, SAMSUNG."
I cant wait to go to the moon with this phone!
"even the ads are same, just changing the s number"
Most people in comment section clearly don’t watch Apple presentations. Amazing phone but substandard presentation by Samsung
If you are FAN of samsung like this comment👍👍👍👍💜️🧡
Its amazing like iphone 12 pro with 14 pro stabilizer camera 😊
I wonder if you would release another budget phone with s pen...
"Mention the price also
Then it will....."
No thanks! Imma stick to the iphone.
Send me one. so that I can show my friends whats new in the s23 ultra
I need one but i dont have money
Boring
"It's appealing, marketing aspect of the video has enticed me to make this purchase, and the 200MP has got me excited. Decisions!! 🤔"
amazing!! The Best Phone I Have Ever Owned. Such a AMAZING device. Thanks Samsung for Creating This MASTERPIECE!
Samsung nailed this time!
So nothing's new lol
so nothing new
With such a powerful phone can you guys finally add controller support to genshin 😭 or make a deal with them
"I am not a fan of Samsung, but that was so cool!"
That guy with the beanie is so cute. lol
Can it flip?
"Right sheep gather round. Let's make a new phone with everything 5-10% better and then everyone can say wow that's amazzzzing and buy it thinking they've just had a massive upgrade.

🐑"
I like when smartphones commercials try to push as much as it is possible unnecessary stats into commercials
I will just wait for Galaxy S25 Ultra :D
for one second when he said ThatWasEpic I was sure Juan was gonna pop out lol.
I don't ever see this much excitement on a boring iPhone. Samsung is really killing it with the s23 lineup. I'm gonna trade my s22 ultra for the 23 ultra
"@Samsung...
Please fix your camera's shutter lag!!"
Nice lang talaga. Pero nagrerelease ng update to destroy the display of s20 flagship phone. To force to buy or replace the old one. Panget ng samsung
I got goosebumps from the cringe. But awesome ad tho. Cool.
Absolutely incredible introduction video
"You know it's funny when Apple Samsung and Google talk about sustainability and not include a power adapter or a case and make the packaging smaller but in this day in age selling a smartphone with a 128 GB and 256 GB storage is a complete waste. We're taking photos, downloading apps, and recording 4K and 8K video on our smartphones which already right there takes up storage. They should make 1 TB and 2 TB phones standard across the board.
Btw Samsung bring back the micro SD slot and put a under screen camera and name it the S24 Ultra, because I don't see any point of getting this phone and will still continue using my Note 20 Ultra."
I need but to much expensive 😭
"Why don't you make s23 series in the same design?
It will be nice holding this phone with the s23 size."
Just taken pre order for S23 Ultra 512 GB RED and can't wait to hand's onnnn 🔥🔥
"S pen Not new
Astrophotography not new
The games I can play here, I can play the same game in Note 20 ultra with same experience...
Stable video, not new,
Quick Share not new...

So what's new? Nothing except for the ad"
Another useless invention. so only some software gimics and some improvements in camera which people will rarely use for day to day photography. Would rather get a camera. Make something new Samsung
Samsung should change the design of their phone.  It doesn't look luxury as iphones.
The long awaited phone is here.
"I love it 😍

Well done Samsung 👍"
Awesome representation 👏
"Good ad, but no major changes or innovation. Skip this series."
"Em suma : nada de mais.
In a nutshell : nothing new."
So basically not much changed?
Cringiest AD ever made by human beings.
"I didn't see any good side, I was expecting a big innovation from S23, especially in the design, but those old things, as for the camera, there is night photo and 8k video mode since S10, so I didn't like S23 at all."
Samsung are decides to destroy iPhone!!! Insaneeeee
"All the camera effects are now possible with SnapSpeed. So, no thanks."
"Hey, what's new? 
Nothing, apparently.

I've been a long-time samsung fan, but Galaxy is taking the iPhone path."
Apple's Father is coming soon.
I pre order already the 1TB
Samsung is  so enviromently friendly that we even use slave labour in kongo mines  to extract raw materials for our batteries .
Apple scared rn 😂
This commercial is adorable can i just say that
No.1 Arrived 🌹🌹🌹
Samsung phones build quality is very poor my S21 Ultra has a green line on the display without any damage
"Well its a dream for me to use this kind of phones 🙂
It keep showing on my feed but I cannot afford one"
1 year later: OMG! I got green line..again?
It's fun and all.. but with all those features I wonder what the battery life is like. And if you turn it into power saving mode you probably won't be able to get all those features
"It's cool, but not worth an upgrade from the 22 Ultra"
Cool
Worst commercial yet?
I am soo happy to see samsung ditched there Exynos
my first Samsung Mobile Samsung Galaxy Y.. 2nd one S3 ...3rd one A7 2018.... 4th one  pending  . if u give this one for me .
"New product yet thicker bezels🥴 and more expensive than the rival (iPhone) if you have the money just buy an iPhone, samsung is not worth to buy, it just waste of money."
Kitna bhi top chip dalde rahega tho apple ke niche h performance mai🤣 per no hate camera zoom quality 🙇‍♂️🙏
I'm waiting for S25 Ultra.
"No cap I went hiking with bunch of friends the other day, only one friend had a note 20. Turns out it took the best photos out of all our iphones. Seriously thinking to get a galaxy lel"
Nothing beats Samsung NOTHING!
Still... nothings new 😂
I have s22 Ultra.. I waiting for s24 Ultra
"You know what i love about this ad, it was the perfect blend of functional features with storytelling. Not too over the top, not to sensational, as android people we love performance and you guys delivered. Thank you"
guys trust samsung they got the best software in android smartphones and beats everyone even ios is no much for oneui 5
Soooo a $1200 system update? 🤔
Definitely getting one
Props to Samsung for not closing the comment section
"most imp question - I have a s22 U , should I upgrade?"
"Seems great despite looking like iterative update. Anyway, one disappointed aspect is Samsung does not up the ante for Ultra Wide Angle Camera. Oppo able to fit same sensor as main sensor on Find X5 pro which have among the best ultra-wide camera (day and night). Wish Samsung put bigger and better sensor for Ultra-wide camera."
The best  smartphone in world
"Samsung took us back to the past, as if we were seeing a smartphone and artificial intelligence for the first time. ✌️🧡"
"Watching it with my samsung note9.... insyaallah, this yesr, upgrade to samsung ultra23"
That was fun ngl
Watching on my A51 😊
This will set history
there should be a boy explaining tech to women hehe
I can't remember the last time a Galaxy launch was exciting.
A new king is born
Die hard fan of Samsung 🍻
Someone to gift me a Samsung galaxy device
24 more days and then i'll have it.
Nothing wen compared to S22 ultra other than 200pxl and processor. No need to upgrade from my S22 ultra💕
Now that's what ULTRA LOOKS LIKE
WHAT IS THE POINT OF UPGRADING THE BACK CAMERA TO 200MP ONLY TO BRING DOWN THE FRONT CAMERA TO 12MP?? Ugh why not keeping the s22 ultra 40MP camera as well?!
Best smartphone introduction!
Please sir gift me s22 ultra 😐
Not apple fan boy but they use real and not production video- photos on their presentations
"Still using s10+ 🥲 no money to buy it, could someone buy one for me?"
"this took me back to the S3 commercial video when it said
designed for humans,inspired by nature
time flies..."
Tell me the difference between 22ultra and 23ultra
so an entire slot for s pen is fitted but they can't fit a 3.5mm headphone jack? this is suspicious at the very least...
Still no charger in the box lol.
"Hi, 

Is that true that Edge Panel, Screenshot Gesture unavailable in Galaxy A13 4G model? 


I bought it recently and was shocked to know this. 


At the same time these are available in low priced M32 prime edition. I really don't know the logic behind this. 


I there any way to get these in A13."
now this is called perfect marketing ad
"Wow, the king of android smartphone has done it again 👏"
Can you send this phone 😁
"Nightography, Quick Share..."
The most unrelated commercial ever made
I missed these cheesy Samsung advertisements 🥰
cringe
Amazing smartphone and i love samsung🔥🔥❤️
I better have the winning lottery numbers and get me one if these babies😍
Also Samsung: let the loans start🤑
Can't wait to have you.
Now the name Galaxy started making sense
"I find curious if these kind videos actually are effective, specially for intended market"
I'n future the I'll launch s23 f ♡♡♡ I will go it.(hope)
What a good device I am looking at Samsung A73
Without processor and 200mp camera sensor all are same as before.
Still happy with my note 20 ultra
That moment I have been waiting for...
Apple who?
"Somebody gift me one please..😢
It's lovely.😍😍😍"
I think this is the best advertisement of any phone that i ever see. Best way of displaying the features in this manner.
Hey what's new 🤣 i say nothing 😂😊
Plzz announce m54 too🙂
Nice ad.
"Nooo thanks ,nothing really new."
I love ad like this
Excellent! Fantastic! What a beautiful phone ad! And a brilliant phone too!
Already ordered s23 ultra. Comin 13 feb.
Still have the Note 10 Plus and works well even when it is just Android 12. Though I am already thinking of upgrading. :D
"They pulled an apple and released the exact same phone, slapped another number on it and jacked up the price, this is literally an s22 ultra 🤣"
"The ultra needs to have a 2TB variant while the the S+ should have a 1TB variant since SD cards have been removed, just hope they make the larger storage options much cheaper to make up for the removal of the SD cards."
Price hike of 20000 in India. Cash back of 8000; so still 12000 hike.
Happy they ditched the exynos for global varient now
"Putting a charging cable and charging brick in the box is a very compulsory and important thing but Samsung treats it as not which proves that Samsung is a very unprofessional company and they give the excuse that they do it for the environment, if Samsung really wants to make sacrifices for the environment then they should find ways to make those sacrifices on their own while loosing their own money but instead they choose to force customers to sacrifice their chargers in the box despite the fact customers are paying the same price for phones with chargers yet not getting a charger, samsung claims to want to save the environment yet they are forcing customers to make a big sacrifice while they don't make any sacrifices for the environment and instead gain a much larger profit from customers by removing the chargers, whether customers want to sacrifice for the environment or not should be up to them to decide cause Samsung does not have the right to choose for them by removing the chargers."
the true beast  💎
"nothing really innovative, too close to the galaxy S22 Ultra for too high a price"
Cringe Commercial.
Still Apple is better
Still Apple is better
Is same as s22 hated design.
Advertisement creativity level 💯
Commercial its iphone🔥🔥
"While I still prefer Apple, I am genuinely happy for Samsung users that the S23 is this cool."
slightly cringe presentation..
New Monsters of Smartphones Arrived from SAMSUNG💥💖
Beast arrived.. RIP Iphone 14 pro max
CRINGE
Seriously asking... what's new ?
Great phone ...
"Nah man 
A very thin line between s22 and 23 
Waste of money 
I would rather buy an iPhone 14 pro."
i thought the girl was camila cabello
"Wont use it even if it was free.
Totally copying iphone but awful in every aspect"
Thank god Black guy appeared in this video. Else U.S almost banned this phone for not having enough diversity in AD.
👆3s.🐱 : 💬🐱Wh.🐱Bl.🐱Gold🐱Gr.🐱...💬
Android must fight like this else iphone monopoly will be horrible.😥
This time don't push updates that' kills the phones motherboard
Watching this on my iPhone 14 plus product red ❤😂
"I've been a constant fan of only one thing, Galaxy series.
😍
Right form Samsung S3, Designed for Humans."
Design of my Note 10+ is stil the best. No chanse to upgrade.
This is so cringy 😭
"With how much focus they put on the photos, you’d think they’re selling a camera. If I wanted to do photography I’d buy a DSLR, not a sh*tty phone with a good camera"
This was truly epic
Skipping this time due to bad trade in offers
Congrats Samsung I am using S22 ultra I wish i could have new one as well... ❤️❤️❤️
I love the Samsung mobiles it's just awesome..
Got a new samsung every last 7years.  I have 22ultra. Must say. I dont get the 23 this year.  Inn fact i mabye go over to iPhone 15
Plz give me one🥺🙏
Now I can buy the s22 ultra in discount 🗿
Samsung's introduction seems more fun and reliable than other mobile company does.
The shitiest introduction ever
Nothing nee
Using waste material from the ocean is good but donating for cleaning the ocean could've been much better
Not worth this price
And I might upgrade from S22 Ultra to S23 Ultra just for that astrophotography.  😍
Please give me Samsung
I always wait for new Samsung introduction videos they are always fun to watch love it as always ❤️
What's new? Uh... Nothing new actually.
is the screen safe ? if it's safe and not easy to strip I buy
Love this one.
Love it
Love you Samsung and design and mobiles series are awesome
The More Samsung Upgrade their Phones the less Apple stands a Chance 🎯🎯🎯
Me poorly watching on my laggerest Samsung A11-32GB-2GB_RAM😭😭 someone sponsor me🙏
Watching this add with my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 😚
"Hey Samsung you nailed it
Unfortunately I'm still using S8"
The s23 is the same S22 let us deceived.
Now reverse the roles and make a sharp guy and doppey women.  Do all men have to be portrayed as dopey?
"the video is still blurry, in the selfie - the guys face came out way too soft"
I really wish I could buy this...
"Wow soo innovative.









Not the phone, just the advertisement."
''Hey what's new?''- - > Nothing! 😅
"As an s23 ultra, I can confirm I'm getting alot of respects today!.
 Yes im smart enough that i can even type hehe😁"
That's an EPIC commercial..... Love s23 🤩
Who is going to take nightography on other planets
How many android updates will be provided?
Love this phone.....
i was getting the feel of s22 ultra in the whole video🤣
Can your iPhone 14 pro max do that 😏.? Hahaha
"No no no Elon Mask - I will stay with my iPhone 📱 

😂😂😂"
Corny But Cool
Is that Fast X trailer 🫡🤭
EXPENSIVE AND DON'T HAVE MEMORY EXTRAIBLE 🤢🤮
i think i will stick with iphone againt :( this to ugly
To much of animation
Evrything is great but my friend with s22 ultra says he has s23 ultra and am sure he gonna be uncaught for 2 years
"Biggest upgrade in history, but in the ends people buying iphone."
Looks like tony stark technology
Fun fact it's filmed on iphone 14 pro max
Bring back the SD card! Then I will buy.
"Your money or your life, read it guys"
Whats with the disgusting colour choices? Black is the only viable one
S-series smartphones are probably the best android phones in any segment all around the globe. Loved it.👏💕
What astronaut doing in the space
@thatwasepic
what's new? — nothing )))
No innovations almost same as note 20 ultra these photo gimmicks can easily be done by software update.
"""What's new?""

That's a right and wrong question.
Let's just ignore the specs, cameras, performance, and all that stuff. Those were the right questions.

The wrong is the phone itself. There is nothing new. The design looks almost the same as S22 Ultra. It just looks boring. The same as iPhone line-ups."
wow this ad is impressive 👏
Ill buy this phone next week im so happy
isn't quick share exists years ago whats new ?
"I own S22 Ultra.
The Battery is the biggest issue plaguing this beautiful device.
Single largest paralysing problem.Period."
I will always be in Apple user
Not much of improvements compared to the last model. Kinda disappointing 😞
"Forgot to mention, price is also epic 😂🤣😆"
Time to retire my S10+
"No sd card 🤔 R.I.P samsung phones , that’s why everybody is going back to iphone and pixel phones 🤓"
waste of money...0 news...
time to upgrade from my S7
Nah I'm sticking with my s21 ultra not much has changed
Np curved edges or very minimal 👎🏻👎🏻
"My dream to get s22 ultra ...
And now my dream is to get s23 ultra"
Vision booster or true tone from apple
my new phone thanks Samsung....
"The turtle:""GrOoVy""🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Bravooo Samsung, An epic ad.😊"
The all new samsung s23 is...
"Please dont ever use Exynos or any in house chip anymore, pleaseeee samsung please!!! We love galaxy series soo much! Please don't ruin it 😢😢😢😢😢"
"The most underwhelming phone premiere I've see to date. The main narrative was about the camera as if a device that is as versatile as a smartphone (being in many case almost as powerful as laptops nowadays) is used primarily and almost exclusively to create content on different levels. So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to. Are the Samsung phones now targeted exclusively towards wannabe cinematographers and photographers? Hard pass for me."
"The lack of expandable storage is a huge deal! I have over 100gb of data on my SD and now I'll have to fork out hundreds of more $$$ just to fit my files!? Everything looks good, nothing groundbreaking though but it's definitely a somewhat good upgrade from my note 20 ultra 512gb which I got the sh!tty exynos chip with but is it really worth all that money for slightly better performance in the processor and camera? I guess we'll see."
I've been waiting to upgrade my note 10+ I'm so excited to get this phone
Happy with the introduction 😊 but sad that I cannot by such an expensive phone I love 😢
"Let's be real here. The most important question is. Is it worth that much? I don't believe so. The entire phone industry went off the rails. Today, this is a camera with a SIM card rather than a phone. Who needs 8k? Even now, 70% of households lack 8K televisions. So there is no need for this. Who requires 200 MP images? Everybody creates images on the fly. Perhaps we have two or three days a year to test all the other features, but in the end, hardly nobody uses this. Prices are becoming absurd, obscene, greedy, and disgusting. Samsung has not really convinced me with this model till some fresh innovation occurs."
Good job guys I'm thinking of getting one 🤔 😀 😄 😉
Im gonna eat that sea turtle
"Great video, however I'll just stick with my Samsing Galaxy S22 Ultra, same stuff a little bit more powerful, nothing really worth the upgrade to the Samsung S23 Ultra. Thanks for the offer though."
Australia doesn’t get snap dragon tho 😅
"I see SpongeBob effect 
😆😄😄"
Felt nostalgic with the intro
Nothing is new 😒
man i cringed so hard through the whole video
Love it 😂
What's new? The price 😂
Reminds me of the good ol days of Samsung commercial.
Those who disliked are probably apple fans...🤣🤣
Perfect
Got it. I'll stay with my s10+
"Well well well this is s23 




Oooo ultra obviously"
They are in loop bro
Excellent extraordinary mind-blowing job SAMSUNG 😍😍😍.give me it for free 😆😆
Mind blowing super
now this is beast
"The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is miles ahead of the competition and is cooler and more stable to boot.

Samsung is making an exclusive overclocked edition for all S23s (NO MORE EXYNOS!!!) and I can't wait for it :)"
Moral of the story nothing anything new .
Astronaut part was good.
Just ordered mine my 10 + has been acting up lately looking for to it coming on the 17th!!
What's new? That they rip you off even more with braindead pricing.
"Its durability increase on every S generation, I'm using S20FE now and its still working like miracle (the last OS updates were game changer)"
"It's too bad that s22 ultra vs s23 ultra are too close... The differences are quite small ... Night graphy 😂 nice play on word Sammy ... How about upgrading ur battery to 5500mah or even 6000mah... Bigger 7inch screen... Nommore curved screens 🤢, real fast wireless charging not regular, faster 100W charging like the competition n putting the actual 100W in the box, better colors not same boring ones, titanium alloy for durability, bring back memory expansion cause monkey see monkey do what Apple does is reductive n embarrassing😂... How about spending millions on optimizing the apps in ur own appstore or even googles ... For the price of ur phones u should offer that and more ... I don't I'm was such a fan of Samsung but they don't innovate anymore other than foldable phones which they failed 4x times cause that's ugly ..."
My Dream phone s23 ultra  🥰
I would rather stick with my iPhone 11pro
S22 ULTRA is available everyone
Looks Incredible
I don't know about s23...but she beautiful.....😍
But why that guy talks like he came from under a rock.
"""We got the most powered processor on samsung galaxy"" loool oh really? 😂"
Lol... This video should have came out like 5 years before... when these things were actually new 🤣🤣
Kind of disappointed with the marketing campaign of Samsung. Hope they will improve next time around
The legend is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
boring
Nice after a long time
"refreshing to see video like this,, fun and informative! love it..."
Okay but atleast ugrade the design?
That was really epic 🤣
The End theme of this ad is similar to K. G. F Theme.
S22 > S23 (value for money)
What a fun ad 🙌🏻🙌🏻❤️❤️
nailed it
"Same design, nothing new it's just a minor improvement... Sticking with my s21U for one more year"
"Nothing special in this model, same design... like S22 Ultra"
"changed the processor and update the camera.
Nothing new"
Watching on Samsung f62
Samsung has the best adverts out of the whole mobile industry no doubt!
Samsung the future of smartphone💟🔥🔥
Samsung needs a new media team or advertising agency.....
Hahahaha how to make people fool with same design
Want to Buy But My Budget don't Allows
this commercial is so cool
I’m an iPhone user and this really attracted me :) Shall I switch 🤓🤓??
Me watching this add with my iphone 14 😂
Samsung is braver than apple.... only demand is great security of data
You guys should gift me one of these devices
"Hype only, price way higher, slight upgrades..... always follows iPhone"
Dream phone 😍😍
i really like your introducing  s23 ultra not like boring presentation.
It will probably only receive two years of security updates
is there trully a lot of peoples who change their phone every single year?
"Though not buying it,but this introduction put a smile on me ❤️"
Wow that’s incredible acting !
a very amazing smartphone.
One of the worst marketing video by Samsung
That’s nice now I can afford s7 edge😍
S23 is here exited🔥
Best of Best is Back
I think they spent less on advertisement this year...🥲
This ad is so cool... 😎
Bore
Where is that was epic Youtuber 😂 ?
Nice introduction
Apple : Lol samsung. Truly copy of other brands.But its ok noone can catch my 14 promax🥱
Best intro of the year I'll say❤️
The editing is of next level to make s23 ultra feel like ultra
"Don’t celebrate too early., iqoo11 will be there.😀😃😊😊"
"When ""Galaxy"" literally makes sense."
So nothing special
I love this
Watching on s22 ultra!
No 10 bit display even 10 bit content are available to watch No IR blaster so this is not a perfect phone almost perfect 😁😁😁😀😀😀
"""What's new?""............describes  most smartphones nowadays."
Pre reserved. Waiting to buy.
Samsung Always Be The Best.!
Hello iPhone haters!
Looks same to same as my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 512 GB which is performing very well even today.
Cool stuff. I really like the phone.
"It was fun watching it. 😊
Awesome introduction 🔥❤️"
Can u send me that 😂😂😂
Smartphone King of the year 💫🥳
"I love it, 💓💓💓💓"
S sirish is amazing ❤️😍
So All it has is a better camera and screen I'll keep my fold 4
"Hey iPhone , your time of death has come so close"
"By far the most creative and captivating introduction film of any product. 

Way to go, Samsung! 💫"
Awesome but no money anyway
Same as old 😢
Wow really cool
If get the chance to buy I still go with S21 ultra model I love it's designed & colour.
Very Creative Director 😂🔥
I mean it looks cool and all but these upgrades always look cool and they end up not really being that different than the previous generation.
I wana try but i am poor very poor
Now it is called performance booster in every thing ❤️😍
This is the most cringe ad that my eyes have ever witnessed
"Perfect but the display!!!
Meant to be the best on a smarter phone...
Not the apple..."
When u hv ntng to boast abt...u say abt the environment
I haven't been this excited for a new phone in a while!
it suitable for night people who like clubbing 
Another s year
I think this is the most fancy Phone Introduction of Samsung right now. 😁😁😆
India pricing please 🙏
"This is Only for rich people ,I just came to watch new phone"
Nailed it... Samsung 23 loading to Rule the 🌍
Who else came here to watch here but no money to buy it!!
No reason to upgrade from s22 ultra
"The design is very similar to S22 Ultra, but I'm rooting for the camera upgrade"
Just enjoy with my SONY XPERIA PRO-I 😌❤️
That nearby share ain’t as good as airdrop lol
Nothing special
All ready loving it 😘
"God, it's so good, Can I catch it!❣️🧗"
"So, the new iPhone is rumored to be without the camera bump, but Sammy copies it even before it comes out? lol. That Vision Booster is also True Tone ripped off."
That's Awesome 😍😍😍😍
Samsung kept the same look as s22 ultra..just to mock 🍏
I think the vision booster is copied from true tone 😅
Iphone🤢
Im a huge fan and user of Samsung Galaxy phone im feeling like insane for this s23 ultra..
My iPhone literally got stuck seeing this video 😂
Hey what's NEW ......
"What's new
TVC : bra bra bra...
Fact : Prices"
"""Hey where's your sled?"" I thought she was going to sit on the S23 Ultra! 😆😆"
"Worst introduction for a any flagship series of Samsung.
Didn't expected this, poor direction"
What s her name
Any new features on Note taking with S pen?? S pen is the main reason many of my friends like this phone.
For some reason this feels like a youtube rewind
Cool
"“Hey what’s new?” 
“Nothing.” 

The end"
ohhhh. galaxy s23ultra. it is great
I got the S21 Ultra 512gb Phantom Navy. I skipped on the S22 Ultra. However I don't think i'll skip the S23 this year 🥲 Getting a 1 terabyte as well if the option is there.
Me watching from a20 😅❤
"Dear Samsung, please understand that if we're a photographer, we'll buy a camera, not a phone -_-  (not everyone is a photographer) I expected more features, I had always followed up the galaxy ecosystems, but I was disappoint...."
Again! Samsung nailed it in Mobile industry.
"Guys, come on. We use Samsung to show Android is better than Apple. Don't let us down like this at least."
Almost same like the Galaxy S22 Ultra.
Bro what is that a monster. A monster that will eat the i phone 😈😈
"From fifth harmony to going solo, to letting us hear ""i'll be home for QUISMOIS"", to S23 ultra. Her influence is so different. Untouchable!!!"
They should hire Juan @ThatWasEpic
Me and my bank account crying in corner watching this 😭
"Great cameras, screen and performance. Not sure of S Pen though."
"YES YES YESSSS, time to throw my iphone away and take this phone to go"
Want to get the s23 Ultra
This was not a good introduction compared to the S8 and S9 years
Why is it giving Airdrop vives? And why do they also have the stable video?
Ooof not the their best commercial
& still GURLS using Iphone 😆🙏🏻
Bro this is cool
That boy is so cuteeeee
hay Samsung please send me that phone my tablet is old a need new smartphone thinks 😖
Is the Google Pixel 8 Pro camera sensor and Tensor G3 processor going to be inferior than S23 Ultra?
Smartphone has reached its peak!!!!!
hey what's new? the gimmicks of the front camera called dynamic island 😅
The moment y'all be waiting for
Excellent Performance & Photography 🤞👌
Now that was epic 🔥
Nothing new ?
"""Look at you with your fancy pen"" is something people actually say, the most realistic line in this video"
I hope the astrophotography mood will come with an update on s22 ultra I love discovering space 😍 ❤️
"I’m still asking , what’s new 😐"
Why not create i phone  vivid filter samsung camera🥺
"Hey, Whats New ? 😑"
Why not polymer battery?
Is this 2023 or 2003 ??? 😍❤️💯
Finally😍
"Unfortunately...
While Samsung phones will be on android, iPhones will be a priority."
this is the best advertisement I have ever seen
Fun video.. but nothing really big as an upgrade if I'm honest (I'm using 2019 midrange phone btw lol)
Nothing new
"Me watching this on my 4 yr old Note10+:
So what's ACTUALLY new?? The front still looks the same as my phone and not much is different."
"Oppo did vision booster last year......,."
"Basically only better cpu, better gpu, better camera, no innovative breakthrough at all"
"Oh dear Samsung U're getting me to buy this great machine, and what a sophisticated and pleasant advertising commercial. U nailed it!"
"Finally Samsung has shed some light on videography. Upto the S22 series, this was the only problem. Looks like they've solved it in it's predecessor"
I must say Samsung Galaxy S23 ultra is the best phone not only for watching videos but also its visual appearance just op 👍
Samsung s23 ultra is my dream phone but not Able to get 🥺my dream.
Not so impressive ……  I don’t think it’s a major update rather than 200 Mp
Upgraded from my z fold 3 😁
Who made this video? Samsung ads are always similar with lots of details that may not be needed. Apple ads are like a short movie/clip we want to see again and again. Step up the game Samsung.
Okay. Must admit this is the best smartphone commercial I have seen in recent times.
"It's fun to watch that Samsung also searching ""whats new"" in this same old sh**ty heavy box! 😆"
"For me, it is just another version of S22 ultra with new gimmicks n commercials."
James Bond's new Gadget
At least samsung keeps comments open u like the fruit apple
Being an S22 Ultra user i thought there couldn't be any better phone and the S23 ultra will jst have some extra stuff and nothing more but these huge internal upgrades are making me want the s23 ultra now😭😂❤️
Can I captured Heaven by Galaxy S23 ultra??
It’s mostly software upgrade. I’m keeping my boring long lasting never lag iPhone 12 Pro Max
I forgot where the things were new.
Nice phone but you not yet to get like iPhone 🤣
"Since the s20/s21, Samsung has not innovate much. The galaxy simply became the note. It’s clear all the R&D is going towards their foldables. People had a reason to go for Samsung 2-3 years ago instead of apple because they were getting new FUN stuff. But now, the iPhone seems like a much more logical phone to get."
Amazing creative production. Kudos to samsung.
"It's a new era, you know for Samsung it's clearly understandable!"
That was a pretty lame commercial
This is amazing! ❤️ ⭐
Oh thanks Samsung for helping me to save money for this year smartphone upgrade. I Ain't buying it
Long time since i saw a video this cringe
It's the same phone using a little bit better AI and big cameras which maybe a normal person can't utilise to it's potential . Not an upgrade for normal person
"I am s22 ultra. For me, what's new."
Naaaahhhh.... I want the SD card slot back!
Where is the SD card slot?
Welp nothing crazy...Miss the old days where innovations was inovations
Did they really just add an obligatory black person right at the end of the advert?
Is it Vlog or Promotion Video ? :))
pathetic improvement
Oh god the fruitger areo vibes
Sorry Samsung. Nothing new. EVERYONE TROLLLEE APPLE.  Will you troll Samsung now?
This phone will change the world 🌎
"Uhm, I think yall forgot to release the new phone lol."
Seems just way Fun like in the past😄😅😂
This ad so cool ❤
I am from Cambodia.  Fan Samsung 4 ever .
"Nah, i still on s22u. Unless speker quality got improve on the ""new""."
NGL but this is kinda boring… a 200 MP sensor is all I see that’s new.
"""Image simulated for illustrative purposes."" 💀💀💀"
"I’m waiting for payday. I’m going to upgrade to this from iPhone. This feels like it could really be useful. Also, Android would be a little better for my job in IT than iPhone."
"I just went back to iPhone just because everyone in my family had them. But I lost so much going back. Like a total downgrade. I won’t lie, I love some of the features iPhone has, but even with that, it’s still a downgrade. Really debating  going back to Samsung."
Absolutely 🤗 epic ....King 👑
Best Phone of the Year ❤️‍🔥
Cringed at the VR game part
"People are always saying the iPhones look the same, but compare this to the s22"
"Ik Samsung commercials can be super cringy sometimes, but now their official/intro phone vids are cringey. The S9, Note 9, S10,  Note 10 & Note 20 vids were the peak imo"
Yeah it looks interesting but i just read the company history of samsung and decided it against humanity to add profit to them
Watching on my S22 ultra.. 🙂
So those 3 got the phone for free already 🤔 wow lucky
Great one! Both intro film and the product looks absolutely promising.
cringe
Rip nothing out of the ordinary ! Sadly the innovation is dying slowly. Or we are reaching the peak of the device innovation.
Introducing the same phone lol
Looks great but I'll keep my note 10 plus non 5g until s25 or when it dies out
I think I should upgrade from S22 Ultra!!
This is why I am a Samsung fan...but can't afford
I Need that Still using Note 8 Since 2017 😎
"So much for the ""mooon"" promotion. You didn't even mention about it at the keynote. 😢"
Not mentioned about battery life😮
"Dear Samsung, Please add the headphone jack back"
Yet I'm still stuck with s7edge 😭😭
Literally goosebumps when she introduces a feature to him
Ah yes... perfect time to purchase last year or 2years ago model
Samsung always promises too much and delivers too little
Iphone
Uninspired junk. Wanted to ditch ios but I wouldn’t pay money for this.
Boring
"I think it's a great phone, but the ads is so unnatural. If this video is the only marketing material, I wouldn't buy it."
Beast Born ❤️‍🔥
"Samsung  , we need IR Blaster Back!!!!"
Me here wishing I could get this 😪
so exited to see iphone 15 this year.... the most powerful smartphone ever.... love it
Samsung need Cinematic mode. That is the point
Can I purchase on EMI?
"0:21 It’s called TrueTone, we’ve had this on our iPhones for YEARS."
Purpose of typical communication is de-prioritized by new mobile phone manufacturers. USPs are not typical communications but digital communication. Interesting.
"Dude I'm impressed by those front and rear cameras❤️‍🔥❤️, I really want one i will start saving money but till then s24 ultra will be launched😐"
"What about the s22 ultra, will we get updates too. if not, I feel like I have been cheated by Samsung."
"Number 23 seems nice  maybe i hold into s24 or maybe s25 max.

Samsung the best Android Phone manufacturer."
1:31 “With your *cut* FaNcy pEn”
"Can you send me that, was awesome"
Already preordered. Wanted to be among the first to get my hands on this one!
Amazing phone with amazing advertisement
a battle of camera phone?
"A slightly faster processor, slightly better GPU, and a slightly better screen.... to the extreme! New camera is nice. But its biggest innovations are in AI software, not in the hardware."
S22 ultra I see not enough reasons too update and trade in offer was pathetic 🙄
I just pre ordered the S23 ultra in lime color! Can't wait to get it and put it in a black otter box LOL 🤡💀
"Samsung will sell more phones if they just make an ultra smartphone in the size of s23 and s23 plus.

Ultra is just toooo big"
"So nothing new..

I mean why would i pay 1200+ dollars for taking pictures of space??  
Smartphone tech progress has stopped from past 3 years. Its very very slow now. Companies are focused more on luring customers in with gimmicks rather than introducing some real upgraded phone."
Same thing each year they realize most of us are npc's and will buy anything even if it looks the same
I think Huawei P50 Pro is better than this one!!! 😭😭😭😭😭.
Send me that 😅👍
will the rest of the world get the snapdragon or exynos chip?
Super smart phone 📱 😍🥰
"Once again, apple proved that, they make the best ads in the market"
So happy snapdragon chips are on Samsung smartphones now
"What about the battery? We need a powerful optimization like, you know, and it will be a very nice evolution for that beautiful phone."
I wish people would see that iPhones are just iPods that can call and text but that Samsung are computers that can call and text. Massive difference between the two. No limitations what so ever with Samsung it's truly like carrying around a really small laptop.
What's not new is the boring design 😭
Am I the only one that can't stand the selfie camera blatantly all up in the screen
What’s new? 🤔
Now I want this even more ..... !! 😍
The ads put a smile on my face
I have s22 ultra
"I watched this video using a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime, hopefully I can get a Samsung S23 Ultra. 😆"
Whats new? 🌞🙄
what's new
"Dear samsung,
I used all flagship models from available all brands im my experience im saying samsung only can give perfect best colour accuracy bright display i used xiaomi 12 pro flagship sony, Motorola, vivo, oppo, one plus, iqoo, apple I phones, nokia, ETC.. They using Samsung display but im honestly gladly thankfully saying perfect display only available in Samsung smartphones ever your display other brands can't give best experience. Also other brand display can't to overcome to give best experience Only Samsung can give display, software, hardware, security ever love you samsung💝one more thing the new boxy look mentally comfortable perfect design (ultra model)"
Umm that’s it .
Love it😍
"Sorry Samsung, i bought Samsung for many years and i would buy the S23 if i could. But my last Samsung will be the last. S23 is just too expensive. It's a huge disappointment charging that much money in times of high inflation. 😐"
This is cute
To save you time: whats new ? the camera 😐
Same as s22 ultra they made fun of apple then did the same exact thing….
Nice... but I'm good with  my 22 ultra.
Finally the beast is here
Still going to use iphone
"Pre-ordered, purchased, can't wait till 2-17-23! In lavender of course!"
"For a top of the line device, this ad is not making me want to buy S23 ultra half as much as previous editions phones ads were published, even the now defunct Note line devices ads were better than this latest one. You used to do so much better Samsung. Disappointed."
Not really that crazy just the 200 mp is wild
Wanted to see some battery improvements :c
Tacky and booooooring.
"Nah, I’m still gonna stick with my iphone ❤"
"Ok ok we got it, good camera and all that but why focusing only on the camera? Where is all the other interesting features?! Am I buying a camera or a cell phone?! 
45minute out of 2 hours event is only the camera! So confused"
Waiting for s23 ultra after pause purchasing iphone 14 pro
"LF kidney buyer, good as new, no issue and functioning well."
"I just got my s22 ultra that past June holy, nah gonna stick with mine for another year or so."
I’m definitely switching back to Samsung 😍 I can’t wait to get the black S23Ultra ❤❤❤
Still no memory card slot
I want one 🤤🤤🤤
Best phone productivity hands down 🔥🔥
So... Nothing new
"Well, at least Samsung is not disabling the comment section even though I'm not a fan of both Apple and Samsung."
this is not for me..cuz i am poor..
"Wow, disappointing."
Vision booster is a True Tone renamed
best camera and futuristic display
"This is the best Samsung commercial in decades! Makes me really want to get the S23. Maybe I will

UPDATE: The retailers are borderline scalpers. The phone costs double the price where I live in the Caribbean. I'll have to sit this one out. Ad is still sick"
Charger included?
"Woah, this advertisement felt like 2013 

Edit: And that’s a good thing :)"
"Same as last , boring ..."
"How about Optimization Samsung 🤔
Did u worked on it"
"I DONT CARE ABOUT CAMERA UPGRADE, IM A GAMER AND I HOPE BATTERY LIFE IS LONGGGGGGG AND FIXED"
I’m excited for this year’s over the horizon
I love the samsung 💟🥶
That's it.?????
The Best of all
Not encouraging upgrade from S22 ultra.
"I will buy this phone in 2025, Amen 🙏"
Punch hole??? Naah
"Ever since the S22 Ultra, I've been the biggest fan of your smartphones! This year is going to be even better, and now with more steady video as well as a vastly improved night mode, I'm sure we will even beat Apple's recording capabilities!"
Worst trade in values ever. Definitely skipping this year.
They just fail to make ads as good as apple
They love that punch hole design
"I must say Samsung has the best video introduction of all time. Kind of disappointed with my trade in value for my s22 ultra, but I’ll hold unto it until next year 🎉"
Samsung's camera doesn't get better than this.
you gotta check the price $$$ £££
Please fire marketing team 🙏
Let's get ready for another battery explosion.
"For those wondering why it looks the same is because they asked us what we prefer for the next thing I believe the questions were

Style(looks)
Camera 
Processor 

the survey was on the app I was one of those who chose performance...I'm glad they listen,hoping in the future someday we get to have the power in the palm of our hands."
"I have been buying Samsung devices sense 21 ultra. This was the trade in offer I have ever seen. $500 for a $1,500 phone, you would offer $1,000 for a less than month again. I have loyal to your products for years, I'm apart of the ecosystem. Watch, tablet, 360 pro, ultra 22. This was a joke and insult to your established customers."
Do we get student discounts for thee S23 ultra too? looks like it could be a great use for school.
fix the android 13 update hi slove battrie fast dain
Cringe boomer teaser
Why does some of the comments sound like auto generate.. 😑
"""we got the most powerful snapdragon on a samsung"" well duh

that's the most Apple thing ever."
How about battery?
500 for trade credit for s22u na samsung you got to do better .. times hard
"The fact that Samsung has comments on and the iPhone 14 pro video has comments off shows Samsung’s outstanding confidence (just a bit of comment bot removal would be much appreciated, though!)"
Just that? How pathetic
Nothing's new!!
I hope these recycled plastics and papers will be cheap price 😂😂😂
its nice but i have my s22 ultra very happy with it will check s25 ultra for next purchase if needed
So corny 🤷‍♂️
"So real? Under sea water? I have note20 ultra before and when it got splashed by sea water, it looses its adhensive and soon the battery become bloated."
Where is BTS samsung ??
"I wish the phone design colours was more retro and cool, fun rather than looking like a corporate phone. Have fun colours like army green, hologram (Samsung note 10+), vintage red, copper, silver metallic etc"
"Honestly I couldn’t tell the difference physically but yeah internals change, good job apple"
What happen to the bada$$ trade in value Samsung? $350 for my S21 Ultra? I'll pass for now.
"The ads are so cringe af, i can't 🤣"
No curved screen ❤️❤️
Simple way to insult the iphone lol
Ok that was underwhelming
Worst samsung video introduction I have ever seen
I wish i could buy this or is anybody want to swap for my Z fold 3?
I loved this video wow 😯
Nothing new borring 🙄❌😵😣
I love the 2022 design. Why change the design when it already perfect.
"Amazing product, horrible video"
"As someone who worked closely with Samsung in the past. This has to be their most weakest device intro to one of their most powerful devices. Video aside, the specs are insane. The video thrill didn't capitave me. Either the features are becoming too much to be helpful or the presentations are becoming less impressive to cause organic thrill.

Or... I can wait to watch other videos and come and edit this comment."
"Anything new, other than a better camera? Which I rarely use."
"Samsung always innovates endlessly, I pray everyone can buy Samsung S23 Ultra. Love it"
Unfortunately for business purposes i have to stick to the IPHONE.
"Nostalgia to the times when smartphone introductions are fun like this

Edit: thank you for the likes 🙏"
"My Flip 4 has been delayed for more than 60 days and has not shipped yet, and you still want people to pre-order?"
This video was cringe af
OLD is now NEW 😢
Is this a camera ad or a phone ad?  What the heck is going on with this smartphone industry !!???
Apple does better promotional videos than you guys will ever be able to. I’m sorry but for some reason their marketing team is just fire
Another great work for Samsung!! Watching this in my s22 ultra so I root for s24 or s25
"This is really disappointing, nothing has changed."
Watching on S10+ 😍
So no need to upgrade from the s22
"Samsung helps to realize my passion as a content creator. I make vlogs using Samsung S21+ and ZFlip3, many viewers think I'm using a professional camera. can't wait to upgrade to s23 series"
I know one day God will answer my prayers i like Samsung product
"This is cringe 
Most crapiest release video😊"
"Not only the phone itself brings nothing new (at least different design from last years S22 Ultra), this commercial is so cheap and...doesn't make any sense. Dialogue, photos with strange colour profile (that for sure aren't taken with any Samsung), videos that have nothing to do with phone, too, sharing (?) presented as a feature...what's happening Samsung, with prices up and bad trade in values, not listening to your customers (memory card slot, curved screen that noone wants...) it looks like you would actually prefer for users to switch to another brand.."
this what perfectnesses really are!
How is this even considered a new phone? It's not even a software patch to the s22
My s20 ultra still runs fine. I can wait a couple more years until I pick this up for cheap. Says a lot.
"Hmm they are now stuck with ""the same design"" fever like iPhone 😭"
Real eco phone is a repairable phone: Fairphone
"seriously, what's new since S20 Ultra?"
Upgrading from A21
"Watching this from my s9+, it is time to upgrade"
That was really Epic
Samsung has started naming everything too now
I need this meh
Pathetic.
I have the s22 ultra as cool as this is ill wait for the 24
Woah
Why do i watch trailer of phones which i can't afford?😹
$700 credit for a 1tb fold 4? Yeah okay samsung aka apple
The Android King Smartphone has arrived! 🇵🇭
Apple fans punching the air rn .
I hope this new device will smash the lag issue on andriod phone
Well I'm glad they admitted that the past versions of the galaxy were inefficient.
No Micro SD...why oh why...
"I used to look forward for Samsung new releases every year and would always buy their newest phones...that stopped with the note 8
No more innovation
Just throw in a better camera and move along 😑"
She looks like Lucia from White Lotus
Iphone or Samsung
The best features of Samsung Galaxy: they're not disable the comments section
"The phone IS better, but I swear, Samsung has GOT to step up their trailer game. 
The iPhone 14's trailer is more engaging."
My S20 is still powerfull.... i will be back for S24 😁
Monkey see monkey do. They gave up on being original or innovative. The only thing they ever improve are the camera and the processor.
"I'm pretty sure if I go up to a random chick on her phone and ask her ""what's new"" I'll be arrested 4 sexual harassment.😭"
"I will keep with Google Pixel 7 pro, better price and GOOGLE IA"
"So instead of actually trying to innovate they are playing it the apple way. Marginal improvements at a slow and steady pace. If I want an iPhone I will get one. If you want a real android device continue looking elsewhere. Even the ROG Phones have come a long way. Samsung just give us back what you took: Headphone Jack, IR blaster, a removable battery with water resistance (S5), and especially the Micro SD card slot. Where has Samsung gone with the absence of D.J Koh?"
Im on S10 and still dont find good reason to upgrade
This is the most amazing of all 🎉❤ you Samsung
"If only Samsung had an alternative to the iPhone 14 pro - really good camera in a small device, e.g. the Ultra lenses in the normal S23. The Ultra is way too big, will only drop it.."
"No shame, Samsung. Really released previous year model with new name. Even your ad characters acknowledge it is lame."
"I just got this phone today, this phone is an absolute beast!
Gaming experience, video, picture quality was amazing!! the preformance on games were great via the snapdragon processor! no lags or stuttering :)"
"Samsung is not a brand, it's an emotion ❤"
"""what's new"" minimal specs to trick you onto buying."
Watching this on my A03🥲
"i think it's time for samsung to stop working on so much specific camera function that doesn't work differently from cameras of 3 generation before (my S22+ takes quite the same picture of my old S20) and start thinking to solve the API problems when apps use default settings camera that ends in horrible, low light and blurry photos."
Who is going to tell him the price? 2500$ fpr the peace of junk
ADORO-TE SAMSUNG...❤❤❤
Ultra is cool. But i like the Note name more.  But still.  Will probably give up my Note 20 for this
I have 22 ultra and i barely use its features so i better save my money 🤣
Unfortunately I think Samsung have done an Apple. Pretty much the same phone as last year.
but why did the astronaut have to die?
Watching this in my Galaxy Note 8. Would consider this year's release if I can get it cheaper. S22 Ultra last year has a New Year's promo reducing the retail price by around 17%. My phone is a bit slow now so I am aiming for a new Phone with S-Pen.
Not only is this weak upg.. trade in values are worst i've seen in long time.  Might be first time I dont get the newest Note.
I expected a bit more. Kind of seems Samsung is pulling some Apple moves.
I'm just glad Samsung doesn't close the comments section like Apple.
Same thing as s22 ultra imma pass
Very expensive
Watching this on my iPhone 13 Pro.
@samsung PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP WITH THE CURVED SCREENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GIVE US A FLAT SCREEN ON THE ULTRAS. The curved screens were cool for the first like 3 generations of phones with it but now it's just not satisfying and more annoying for case protection than anything. Please next year move on from this design already no more curved screens thanks.
"Just keep your old phone,there even to lazy to change the design a little"
"Congratulations
Commenting from my Galaxy Note 8 phone👍🏻"
"I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE IS PRAISING SAMSUNG FOR THEIR ""NEW PHONE"" BUT IN REALITY THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL IN IT."
Watching this masterpiece on my Note 9.. I guess it’s time to upgrade 🎉
Should i buy the S22 or this? My current one is S10+
"Another year, another Samsung phone and another year that people isn't going to buy that stupid phone."
using S10 + for morethan 3 years now it's time to upgrade to S23 ultra.  Yaeeeyyy 🤩👌
"I'm a long time Galaxy user, but this time it's a big fail. Not interesting presentation at all. Samsung talk more about collaborations that show new features. Nothing new."
I think Samsung didn't improve much 😕 even this video is awkwardly presented everything looks so fake and half completed 🙄 I personally expect more because Samsung are capable of making great tech 😉 but this time it looks like unfinished project less innovative and more talking the biggest mistake Samsung has made was to rename Note series to galaxy series I love note before they are innovative 💡 and creative I can't explain how much I love note 😀 and Samsung ruined this successful smartphone this S23 ULTRA its looks awesome  but that's all pretty much like S22 ULTRA
I'm still rolling with a Nokia 3310 😎
U even copied the iPhone 14 pros space black color😑
So cheesy
Boo by an iPhone 14 pro
200 MEGAPIXELS MY @SS I BET ITS NOT EVEN GOOD AS THE iPhone 14 pros 48 megapixels
"Pre-ordered mine in graphite. Upgrading from note 20 ultra. Little bit sad that micro SD card is no longer available, but glad that s-pen still made the cut."
This is the cringiest video I've ever seen
Hit like if you’re waiting for iPhone 15 series.
This is S22 ULTRA
Why is the trade-in value in the US so bad this year though??
But why you only giving 500 for my 22U
"***Make sure the z fold 5 has an ULTRA version, so the front screen is wider, and the media on the inner screen is also larger than on a regular phone"
My s20 fe broke recently so now I'm using a s10 plus rn but soon upgraded to this ultra 5g
What a stupid ad. 💩
That is the most ugliest introduction ever
Definitely switching from IPhone
"Looks so awesome 👌 
Got the S22U, it's AMAZING...
I'll be back 4 the S24U 😎😎😎"
"Hey, what's new????????????? 😡👺"
"Heh, even Samsung wanted to join in the ""avatar way of water"" fun, all they needed, was the blue people😂"
Same as the S22 ULTRA hahaha
Why is Apple doing the coolest commercial and presentation?
Just wow!
"I can't believe the crooked people in the comment section thinks the ""S23"" has something special in it.😑"
😃Finally galaxy s23 line-up now on!!
The bezzles aren't any smaller? 😑
Basically same as last year
Nothing new
"This ads is really bad. Old ads was better. This  ads looks  trying to shoe  s23 ultra   bad.  Photo colors , vidro stabilization  and etc on video is too bad."
The Most patetic video ai never see
The comments seem like staged by Samsung buzzers
A lot of people woke up today excited for this Phone! And now a lot of people are skipping your product for another one after the atrocious trade-in values. Good luck with having angered some of your most consistent customers!
When he said that was EPIC. I was expecting Juan from @thatwasepic to show up.
Still sticking with my S20 Ultra for another two years or so. But looks good!
Hopefully the reels will be better with the s23 ultra..with iphone it looks much better unfortunately
Nothing new 😔
This ad has an old school ads vibes
who has time to use full time or wasting time 😂 every body used only for text media make calls and photos 1080p 😂😂 wasting time amigos so
As someone who has a S9 and loved taking photos on my phone. This is what I'll upgrade to
Horrible add... I'm getting the phone anyway.
"1:26 ""Image simulated for illustrative purposes"" LOL"
Just upgraded to this from S21 Ultra.
What dumb add lordt
Samsung used to make fun of apples design being repeated over and over again and now..
Samsung please give us brighter colors like Matte Red and Neon blue next year
That was one lame video. Bring back ghe more serious ones from like the s7 s8 s9 s10 days. Even the s22 tops tbis. This is garbag e
"This thing is mind-blowing 🤯... Well done, Samsung 👏🏾... Nice Film too 👍🏾"
What is the NPU?
They’re all the same from last year. ☕️
Worst ad from Samsung 🥴
"I don't get it, where the MicroSD slot we all wanted?"
"Samsung smartphone, users we the ones💪💪💪"
"Just saw the price, if Apple allows sideloading later this year Im going iOS"
"The guy just like me, couldn't afford one yet so excited to see 😂😭"
"Samsung you want to make something cool please please make a samsung mega with a flat screen 7.2 inch with a 18:9 aspect ratio that would sell,  we gamers have spoken enough of narrow curved hershey bar phones."
"Who else agrees with me that we hate your marketing, your pricing and your lack of inovation.Also letting google command your software and further limiting it is not a good move.Good luck selling your 2018 tech and sinking down as a company. You just make us more and more mad year after year. P. S. Former user of more  than 15 of your devices"
Apple Crying
It's basically the same as my S22 Ultra just with slightly small amount of features. So no point of upgrading . . .
Pre-ordered waiting for my new device :)
Needs 3 more cameras
boring
theres nothing new 😂 my s10 still better than that
"regardless, I will buy the phone, but I felt like the commercial could have been better. The s10 commercial is my favorite so far."
That ads. Is epic🔥
New Galaxy S23 ultra! 🤑
So... what's new? xD
"Still whats new   same work was done by S22 ultra 
 Whats different  ,u could not differentiate   it from earlier  one"
Save your money dont buy this phone. Worst trade in values and preorder gifts. Samsung has become Apple.
"I think I'm getting this phone, but the video is so cringe."
Give me for free please 😭
Wow lovely 🥰🥰
Cringe
I have an s21 ultra phone over heats after 25 min of using camera.  Will I have the same issue?
My galaxy a51 has a super amoled too.
"If you buy the s23U coming from the s22U congratulations, you bought the same phone twice."
RAY TRACING
No headphone jack and microSD card slot... I am sorry but this is not something which is worth more than my S10+
"Hey, whats new? Camera and snapdragon only 🤣"
Meh ... if we got a charger in the box I'll get one
This one or the iPhone 14 pro max :) ?
Boring
Is this phone will appear green line after upgrade software?? 🤣🤣
"hello samsung. I am froum Algeria
I want free smartphone samsung galaxy S23 please. thank you samsung . The best phone"
The guy that jumped the fench from apple side is switching to s23. FINALLY!
That camera is horrible iPhone still the goat Samsung can keep the 100x zoom 😅😅😅
Nothing new. What is that “Quick share”?  Poor copy Airdrop LOL.
I never understood their brand position
Very nicely the ad has been made...lesser music and more detailing of the features.👍
"- Look bottom left
- Nope !"
Told me nothing
"Nice introduction!! btw, the director are very creative! congratulations!  What's news? It's the samsung galaxy S23 Ultra!!!!"
"Not much of a change, I mean those significant numbers given is not that of to look forward."
"Congratulations to the World 
Here is another greatest creation from Samsung 
Best wishes for you my love Samsung ❤"
"Hei what new, nothing new"
"Secretly need a Samsung device to share the epic of what's New!

Wow! This is goooooooood!"
As always the best smartphone on the planet🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"I'm a Samsung fan since the 1st Galaxy, but this was CRINGE"
"S22 was already amazing
this is also Gonna be Amazing."
Would really like to see Samsung Galaxy go back to the S6 Active / metal or even renewed plastic designs for the back plate. Guess I'll just have to keep wishing.
"after watching a full video, I didn't understand what is new in this mobile that S22 Ultra doesn't has? sorry to say you dear but the person who creates the S23 ultra should watch this video and the Video From S22 Ultra and then he understand what is new."
Alright this was hella cringe but excited for the phone.
The most powerful phone in the world 🔥
Always the best🫡
Love love love! This will be my next new phone. Haven't felt the need to upgrade my S10+ since release... I think now is the time and I'm EXCITED!!!!
cringe
"Good phone
But, seems like the same phone no?
Would've been nice to introduce 50w charging, or
6.9 screen
4 speakers"
So basically 80% it's software upgradation..
Everything but a phone
Im wait for this moment along time ago ...thank you so much
"i dont trust samsung anymore had the s22 and s22 plus, the battery is the worst overheat and will just shut down the other thing is lag asf, i hope this new samsung s23 is better but i doubt it, they never really change their battery and thats the main problem"
Make sure you guys fixed the backglass adhesive issue.
"""Galaxy!"" - Sumira Heanna of Love Love Superstar ✨✨"
They need to make the Ultra flat-screened.
Same like Samsung S22 Ultra with some modification.. Awesome it is 💕
Those rings around lenses are amazing 👏
Can I trade my s22 ultra 5g with the 23 ultra
so after mocking iPhone for no innovation and just upgrading camera Samsung did same. Cool!
WOOOW!!! Just bye iPhone 
"Still didn’t catch up to Apple’s 2000 nits peak brightness. And the CPU speed still isn’t as great as iPhone 14 Pro 😂 

And there are still Samsung fanboys who are going to defend these new phones as “more innovative than Apple”."
Nothing to offer..will be a disaster
Awesome update Samsung 👏👏
"I love it 
who want to buy my s22 Aultra it's like like a new"
The phone is cool but the trailer is cringy
Is that the girl from white lotus?
"What a crazy time, we had all this bad stuff going around and now Amazons LPA33X finally shows what happens when you do something smart with your life. Sounds crazy I know but this is actually the first time I was really, really happy since the whole covid thing started"
2023 is really turning the tables now that Amazons LPA33X hit the road. After all these years of barely reading anything good I was usually just shutting down any type of media as much as I can but this brings back good lights and it should give hope to some of you that no matter what is going on in the world at the end something good comes to surface
We really need to talk about Amazons LPA33X I think it's going to make 2023 to be the best year of the entire 2000-range
Think about if you could have your own fate which is possible with Amazons LPA33X. What do you think happens after inflation? I am sure they will keep living cost high and even if the whole war finally gets to an end that still doesn't fix anything for us. Truth is we are getting ripped of every day and there's not much to do about it except for using the projects which actually HELP
Omg i cant wait to buy the iPhone 14 after this
"Want to know why this year everything will be different and for long time actually better? The answer is all in Amazons LPA33X and I have never been that excited for a long time, thank you for providing home and food for my kids"
"I was sure last year would end badly for me but I think Amazons LPA33X is spot on with what they do and how they do it. Can't say for how long it's going to work and for sure it is overyhped right now but even for half a year or something it would be smart to ride the wave and then jump away eventually but the thing is why this is smart right now is because it's so cheap, won't ever find a better entry than now"
Just wanna say.. My heart goes to the entire community for Amazons LPA33X building up something which is worth it for everyone. This is so smart by them to launch it to shatter the doubts and fears of the common folk which shouldn't even exist to begin with. Everyone knows the state of inflation and recession now and the way out is already in progress. Now it's just about catching the big fish
"Just checked the article on Amazons LPA33X. It's definitely happening right now and I'd want my part of this cake, who is dining with me tonight?"
Pre-ordered the S23 Ultra
6000 mha bateri? No Best camera selfie? No Periscope camera Best ultimate tecnología? No Protecion ocular eye Amoled dysplay? Noooo Cristal lens fluorita ? Best Vibrator powerfull ? Noo no ultra
I Just buy it know I wait 😳🫣 🤔 let see how it will be
"With almost 60 years of age I kept my doubts on the current environment. But Amazons LPA33X is seriously smart, it doesn't matter how old you are, this will provide for you and your family which is my only goal in the last years I have to make sure the children are fine"
This is cool😵‍💫
Was waiting for it to drop but vid basically its saying nothing new...
it started with nice and end with EPIC !!
Option A: Do nothing with your life. Option B: Amazons LPA33X - Make your choice
"In so many ways the worst is behind us. Amazons LPA33X does the EXACT right thing to turn around and everyone reacts already, whether that is big companies or just individuals it's a global revolution and not to be missed. But I am just a guy commenting, you should make your own mind on this"
Needless to say Amazons LPA33X is the best thing this year. Yes I don't care if this is related to the video as long as I can help someone for real
Me watching this on my 12 ultra and wondering where the 1 inch Prozesser is. 200mp with no light is still not good. Even when you bind it down to 12mp. Buy the 12 ultra
The immensive 'S'
"That astronaut, lol 😆"
"Still using my Note 9, but I might finally upgrade 💯"
I don't have credit card to preorder i only have debit card
where it's the  different between 21 22 23 ultra ?
"The hypocritical approach of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” that Apple has worked their phones by for years, is the new way for everyone.

But I’m honestly happy that Samsung finally figured out it’s about processing more than it is about hardware. Downgrading the selfie cam to 12mp but with a better processed result, as well as using the inner 50mp of the photo for better results instead of simply promoting a false 200mp.

Better battery, faster UI and less laggy camera app. That’s the way to upgrade your product. Hooray Samsung. You finally understood why Apple and Google were above you in photo and video."
Apple has been real quiet after this dropped.
I'm Myself rocking on Google Pixel 7 Pro 😇
"""Hey, whats new"" ""Nothing"" *video ends*"
"These new phones   have been pointless for some years now... The only  aspect that keeps increasing is the price!
These would be great if it was the year... 2000😁"
Samsung created this film with in mind that people will ask what's new than s22 ultra 🔥
Ordered just now 😍
"Well
I’m an iPhone user 
But I guess s23 ultra is really impressing me"
The best phone for another time 🤯🤯🤯
this is by far the best introduction for a phone I've ever seen in my life really amazing Samsung 🌟
Great phone
Just wow ad.
"What's new?
Nothing really. 😕"
Yeeeh think different😎
great stuff Samsung as always! doing my pre order now!
"I love Samsung ♥️♥️♥️♥️
From Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩"
Im excitedbto upgrade from s21 ultra to this beast!!! 🥰🥰😍😍😍
"Nothing new, looks the same as S22 Ultra. Also, looks like this was made to be cringy to everyone except maybe Gen Z."
"I've always used Samsung, and I always knew they were superior compared to iPhone."
I'm big fan of Samsung ♥️♥️♥️
"Wow I am amazed at what Samsung does every year with the s-series and especially the s23 ultra, for me there is no competitor to the Samsung, which is the strongest and the best in everything . Love your Samsung ❤️❤️❤️"
Wow. We all need to check this out real soon.
"🤣🤣🤣 An Introduction of everything, but nothing new! 🤣🤣🤣"
this is so cringy lol
I just got the Samsung S22 in December and now the S23 Ultra is out! Looks interesting
Skipping the upgrade this year. Samsung's only giving $500 trade-in for the S22 Ultra and $150 in accessories. Last year they gave me $680 for my S21 Ultra and $200 in accessories during pre-order. Really disappointed this year.
I'm waiting this phone before one years ago I'm so excited wow thank you so much Samsung
"Every single year, their official introduction films always amaze me. Idk who comes up with these ideas but I applaud you 👏🏾👏🏾"
Briefly nothing new
"Apple when new phone: It’s the same, we just made everything slightly better but that doesn’t really change anything. Anyway, buy it now
Samsung: whooooo we’re in gaaallaaxyyyyy"
Honestly kinda meh…
"this commercial especially the procesosor part is so cringe, iphone commercials are just better"
Such detailing is mind supernova-ing😍😍😍
Won't update.  Thanks 🙂
THIS IS INSANE 🥰🥰
Great can't wait 😍
I just get depressed by this as I have the Exynos version.. Which is straight up garbage compared to the Snapdragon variant..
"Bye bye 14 pro max and S22U, HELLO GALAXY S23U!!!!!🤩😍🤩😍🤩"
I am happy with my Samsung S22 ultra from last one year daily driver............
"Still not 2,000 nits brightness."
I wish Samsung would give its galaxy phones a holographic keyboard someday
The S23 except for the minor changes will still be my favourite phone
But why same display panel as s22 ultra?  Or is it the new e6 amoled?
"Incrédible.
Pre-ordering Now!"
"That's gonna be hard for iphone to top , ngl"
I can never buy it but it was good to see the reviews. I love Samsung a lot.
Is this really Samsung's new flagship phone commercial commercial ?

Whats new? Nothing
1:12 my dudes hanging out on Titan
InshaAllah I will own this phone
Fix the signal issues with the S22 Ultra first and then we can talk about this one.
that intro was awesome. fun ad
Take my money..now
Thank you very much Samsung Galaxy came with surprises beyond what we expected and I think we would like to thank all Samsung Galaxy family and employees who have been very successful 👍👍🙏🙏
Only if I actually wasn't poor ://
Samsung has now bigger cooling system. beast GPU CPU for gamers. Beast Nightography. Exclusive processor for Galaxy only.
I wish if I have enough money to  buy it
"Why isn't there a headphone jack if it can game?
Why isn't there a microsd card if I wanna store more videos, and why isn't there an IR blaster to help me turn on TV imma use dex with? And why isn't there a physical controller support for genshin impact for you phones? I'm done with you people that's why Xiaomi will probably win or maybe even ZTE Nubia redmagic Sony is also a good competitor so long Samsung"
"Samsung fack products,
I phone real! 📳"
"Fancy and a recycled,breaks easier in translation.🤣🤣🤣New camera,nothing else,no jack 3.5mm ,no expandable storage.Sorry i prefer SONY"
"Reduced Shutter lag, wow samsung🔥"
Great now make the trade in deals getter and I'm sure you'll sell alot more they were way better last year
Same as s22
The Camera Upgrade is real.
Pov your watching it on a iphone. (yes i am that person). but i like the phone!
It's good
Thats what i call innovation
cringe
I need a device also😞like Samsung s23
This video shows that you can keep your s23ultra and wait another year
"This is gonna be  Killler 😈😈😈in smartphone history 
                         Nd Samsung s23 ultra🔥 will kill it ND make history 🔥🔥"
Worst phone of century- samsung
The best and most powerful smartphone from now ♡
This phone will destroy benchmark test charts this year.
"so basically nothing is new =, and you make fun of apple lol"
It’s okay to say that both Samsung and Apple are underwhelming.
"share the epic 🫢
what a joke 😂"
Interested in the phone but the girl in the stupid ad was annoying
"Superb excellent amazing phone
Samsung always top class...."
Bring back sd card and headphone jack
Fastest pre-order in my life
Waiting for 💥❤️
"his reaction is funny though.
""expert who""🤣"
No graphene battery that you were promising in 2020? Why not?
This was a cute introduction ngl. 😂
The Most Epic Phone right now.
Unexpected… pro phones are just like children in front of this ultra… This is the BAAP of all phones
Does it have satellite communication like iPhone 14??
Are you getting 12gb ram with the 512gb pre order?? I noticed a few retailers only said 8gb with 512gb storage.
I love this s22+1 ultra
I wish they would hide the front camera!!!
Phone of the year Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra already won Phone of the 2023. 🔥💚
Can't wait for mine to get delivered!!!
this is cute! hope battery 🔋 life has no issue on this one 😍
"I think they are running out of ideas. Nothing much new here. Not much innovation at all. It’s the same with apple. Hey, it’s 2023. These look like phones that have been here for years. R&D need a good stiff kick up the 🦵💥  jacksie 🤔"
"their putting a huge push on taking pictures and videos in the dark and stable videos and stuff thats great but im not big on the camera features at all like in general, but i am happy that the cooling vapor chamber is bigger and more efficent. but thats it, its gunna be a good phone but ill wait. happy with my s22 ultra."
I have iPhone and I’m good.
"the pre-order deals are terrible :/
No upgrade for me"
Just wanna know hows the battery backup?
"Now we feel the real innovation, Galaxy S23 series feels the power"
For the love of god just fix the thermal throttling
What a disappointment.
i love the ad
I like Galaxy s10 Introduction better.....
The video of S22 Ultra with Sia's music was way better
perfect smartphone
"Since the snapdragon 8 gen 2 support recording videos in 8k 60 fps, please add the ability to record 8k 60 fps in an software update, @Samsung"
Nice introduction film 🤩👌🏻
New only 3
There is no emergency messaging like the competitor?
The green S23 Ultra is awesome💚.
"It's more like Youtube Rewind, the concept 😭😭😭😭"
"Bruh, I expected a better official introduction video for the S23 Ultra. The Galaxy S21 and S22 Ultra introductions were so amazing!"
The S23 ULTRA is *groovy*
Captivating Ad !
I just don't feel the impulse of buying one after video. Where's the innovation?what's the change?
To many bots in the chat also is that it???
Now that's how you do an introduction film. Kudos Samsung
S9+ to S23 ULRTA!  I'm In heaven! 😍👍🏽
"Super excited, sumsung is better than iPhone"
"What's new? 
Galaxy S23 Ultra"
I bought  Samsung galaxy S23 ultra its only 1.14 lakhs
This ad is so cringgeeeeee
"What Samsung doesn't understand,  most Samsung ultra users(bcz it looks like note series) are boys. And boys want not shiny cameras but very powerful chip, stable internet , stable fps. You can't still stream games by connecting to laptop with your 23 ultra, bcz it affects performance or some other thing in the long term. S22 was too much disappointment for me and changes are not that big on 23ultra."
Ham. To redmi 11 prime waale hae 🤣
IAM going to buy this
Keeping my S22 Ultra until the S24 at least
"What are the colours of s23 ultra? Edge or more flat screen? Nothing say... An incomplete presentation 😪
But the phone is Epic 😍"
30th comment
It's crazy how brighter the vieos are on the S23 🔥
I love it S23 with one ui 5.1 ❤️😃💯
S23 ultra - the best smartphone in the world. Samsung will rule year 2023 with S23 🔥🔥
I DREAM WITH THIS SMARTPHONE T_T I want ittt so so much!
The definition of cringe
"""Hey, what's new"" was epic"
"Terrible introduction video, aswell as the unveiling and the unpacked event itself, just unprofessional and cheap. Last years unpacked and marketing was perfect"
Samsung got nice phones but....God! They are terrible at advertising 🙄.  Unlike Apple does
It is another Roasting 😂👍🌟🌟🌟
My S 21 fe working just fine 🙂
"THIS ONE WILL BE THE BEST BY FAR, OFC BETTER THAN APPLE'S iphone 14"
SAMSUNG can I have one of them?
Unbeliveable Innovations
